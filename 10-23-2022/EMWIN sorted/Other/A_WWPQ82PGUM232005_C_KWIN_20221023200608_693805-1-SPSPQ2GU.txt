...HEAVY SHOWERS EXPECTED AND STRONG GUSTS POSSIBLE THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY...

A broad tropical disturbance stretches across Yap State. The center of
this feature is located  near 9N137E just west of Yap proper, based on
on the most recent ASCAT B and C passes. Maximum sustained winds are
10 to 20 knots. Heavy convection is forming along a convergence axis
that runs from the Equator at 134E to north of Yap near 12N140E. 

Models show the circulation stalling, and the "tail" of convection 
training over Yap through Wednesday. Not only have models initialized
this setup well, there is significant and consistent model agreement
through Wednesday. Rainfall totals are expected from 5 to 8 inches
with locally higher amounts up to 10 inches. Gusty winds and elevated,
choppy seas could make conditions hazardous for small craft,
especially on Wednesday.

Be alert for rapidly rising water levels at rivers or streams, and for
local flooding in poor drainage and low-lying areas. Residents should
stay up to date with the latest information from the Yap weather
service office and emergency officials. The latest forecast can be
found under WMO header FZPQ52 PGUM (AWIPS PIL: ZFPPQ2) and also on
our website at: www.weather.gov/gum
