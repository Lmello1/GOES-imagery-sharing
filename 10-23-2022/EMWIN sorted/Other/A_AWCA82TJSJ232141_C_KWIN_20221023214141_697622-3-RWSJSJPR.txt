Today, a more typical pattern prevailed across the U.S. Virgin Islands.  
Nevertheless, some passing showers did make their way into the islands.

fluctuated in the upper 80s to near 90s.

Seasonally typical conditions are expected to continue through
early tomorrow morning. Temperatures will fall into the upper 70s to 
low 80s tonight before increasing to daytime highs in the mid-80s
to near 90s. Tonight, winds will remain light. Tomorrow, expect 
better moisture to reach the islands. Current models suggest 
precipitable water values reaching 1.5 inches of rain. Winds will 
be easterly from 5 to 10 mph. High temperatures will range from 
around 90 degrees to the mid-80s.

East winds of up to 10 knots will prevail across the waters. Meanwhile, 
there is a very weak northeasterly swell affecting the waters, as
well. Seas of 5 feet or less are expected for the offshore
