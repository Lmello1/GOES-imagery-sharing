* Low Risk of rip currents - The risk of rip currents is low,
however, strong currents can occur near jetties and reef channels.
Always have a flotation device with you in the water.

Moderate Risk of rip currents - Wave conditions support stronger
or more frequent rip currents. Always have a flotation device with
you in the water

High Risk of rip currents - Large waves will produce strong rip
currents, especially along narrow reefs and beaches. If caught in
a rip current, swim parallel to the beach rather than against the
current
