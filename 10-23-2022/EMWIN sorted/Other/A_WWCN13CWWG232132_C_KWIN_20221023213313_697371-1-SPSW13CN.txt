==DISCUSSION==

SNOWFALL WITH TOTAL AMOUNTS OF 10 TO 25 CENTIMETRES IS EXPECTED. 

A COLORADO LOW MOVING THROUGH THE EASTERN PRAIRIES WILL BRING HEAVY 
SNOW TO PARTS OF SASKATCHEWAN AND MANITOBA. SNOW WILL CONTINUE 
OVERNIGHT INTO MONDAY MORNING, THEN TAPER OFF FROM SOUTHWEST TO 
NORTHEAST LATER MONDAY INTO MONDAY NIGHT. 

STRONG NORTHERLY WINDS ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO ACCOMPANY THE FALLING 
SNOW. EXPECT VISIBILITIES TO BE REDUCED WHILE TRAVELLING IN HEAVY, 
FALLING SNOW.

BE PREPARED TO ADJUST YOUR DRIVING WITH CHANGING ROAD CONDITIONS. 
RAPIDLY ACCUMULATING SNOW WILL MAKE TRAVEL DIFFICULT. VISIBILITY MAY 
BE SUDDENLY REDUCED AT TIMES IN HEAVY SNOW. IF VISIBILITY IS REDUCED 
WHILE DRIVING, TURN ON YOUR LIGHTS AND MAINTAIN A SAFE FOLLOWING 
DISTANCE. TAKE FREQUENT BREAKS AND AVOID STRAIN WHEN CLEARING SNOW. 

SNOWFALL WARNINGS ARE ISSUED WHEN SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL IS EXPECTED. 

PLEASE CONTINUE TO MONITOR ALERTS AND FORECASTS ISSUED BY 
ENVIRONMENT CANADA. TO REPORT SEVERE WEATHER, SEND AN EMAIL TO
