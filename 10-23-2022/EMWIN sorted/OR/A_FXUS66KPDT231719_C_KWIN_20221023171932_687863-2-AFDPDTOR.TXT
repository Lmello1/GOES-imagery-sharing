.MORNING UPDATE...The forecast is settling into a brief dry period
this morning as an upper trough continues to dig into WY and a
transient upper ridge moves into the PacNW behind it. Nighttime
and morning visible satellite imagery showed a cloud shield
persist across the eastern half of the Columbia Basin and the
eastern mountains, limiting any nighttime radiative cooling. Due 
to downsloping winds along the I-90 corridor, most of the Kittitas
valley stayed just above freezing, with only a few stations 
reporting temperatures at or just below freezing overnight, while 
portions of central OR and the Yakima valley were below freezing 
for at least a couple of hours early this morning.

Today, dry and seasonable conditions will persist across the
forecast area while a transient tilted ridge moves across the 
PacNW. The ridge will place the forecast area under a north to
northwest flow aloft, which will allow for light precipitation to
continue across the Blues and Wallowas through early this
afternoon. Otherwise, the rest of the forecast area will see clear
to partly cloudy skies and light winds through much of the day. By
tomorrow morning, the next upper trough is set to impact the
PacNW, with rain and mountain snow chances increasing throughout
the day. Made minor adjustments to overnight temperatures and
PoPs, with rest of morning forecast package on track. Lawhorn/82

.AVIATION...18Z TAFs...VFR conditions will persist during the next 
24 hours. There will be increasing clouds this afternoon and tonight 
as another weather system moves into the Pacific Northwest. Rain 
chances will increase late tonight and early Monday morning. CIGs 
will lower to 050-070 by 12Z. Winds will be light most of the time, 
but may gust to 10-15 Kts at times this afternoon and early evening, 
mainly at KDLS, KPSC, KALW and KPDT. 88

.PREV DISCUSSION... /issued 430 AM PDT Sun Oct 23 2022/ 

.SHORT TERM...Today through Tuesday night... The region receives 
a brief reprieve from the wet and active conditions today before 
two weather disturbances hit the Pacific Northwest in quick 
secession Monday and Tuesday. Current water vapor satellite imagery
depicts the departing trough of low pressure continuing to 
progress further east into the inter-mountain west leaving us in 
presiding north-northwest flow aloft. Skies have at least partial 
cleared for a fair portion of the CWA outside the mountain zones, 
and winds are anticipated to lighten further in the coming hours. 
With dewpoints at or below 32 degrees in the Kittitas/Yakima 
Valley and central Oregon where the aforementioned clearing is 
occurring, a sunrise freeze still appears possible. As a result, 
the Freezing Warnings for these zones will continue until 10am. 
Outside of these concerns, conditions today stay rather benign as 
a transitory ridge of high pressure moves across the region. There
may be enough lingering 1000mb to 700mb moisture to support 
continued isolated to scattered showers over the eastern Mountains
and to a lesser extent the crests of the Oregon Cascades as 
depicted by HREF and other guidance. However, this activity likely
dwindles as the day progresses, ending by sunset; little to no 
impacts. 

Both deterministic and ensemble guidance are in excellent 
agreement regarding our next weather disturbance slated to arrive 
Monday. An upper-level trough drops southward into the CWA 
bringing precipitation the Cascades starting late tonight into 
early Monday morning, likely as snow down to 4000ft at first. As 
Monday morning progresses and precipitation quickly spreads to the
rest of the CWA, rising temperatures aloft associated with a warm
frontal boundary helps to raise snow levels to 5kft for the 
northern portion of the CWA and up to 7-8kft in the Oregon 
Cascades. This should limit pass snowfall concerns for a time. 
Snow levels then lower Monday late afternoon evening in response 
to the passage of the trough axis and associated cold- frontal 
boundary, settling near 3.8-4kft overnight. Fortunately, 
precipitation will have switched over to terrain driven shower 
activity by the time snow levels bottom out. Due in-part to the 
bulk of the QPF and lowest snow levels having little to no 
overlap, winter weather highlights don’t appear necessary at this
time. It’s worth pointing out the frontal passage late in the day
Monday likely produces period of breezy conditions through the 
Kittitas Valley and eastern Columbia Gorge into the Columbia Basin
and surrounding foothills. Gusts of 25-45mph are anticipated, 
highest in the Kittitas Valley, Simcoe Highlands, and over some of
the ridge-tops near western end of the Columbia Basin. 

As this first trough of low pressure exits the region Tuesday
morning models indicate a temporary shift to westerly zonal flow
aloft and a subtle albeit very weak shortwave ridge feature 
passing overhead. Terrain driven shower activity likely persists 
in the Cascades for much of Tuesday while the rest of the CWA 
dries out. However, any break is short lived as a second trough of
low pressure digs into the Pacific Northwest late in the day into
Tuesday night. This brings yet another shot of widespread 
precipitation to the area accompanied by snow levels quickly 
dropping to 3.5-4.5kft in the evening and overnight. Compared to 
the prior disturbance on Monday, snowfall is likely more impactful
for the higher pass areas headed into Wednesday morning. 99

.LONG TERM...Wednesday through Sunday...Models are in good 
agreement that an upper level trough will be passing over the 
region on Wednesday and then exiting overnight. This system will 
bring another round of rain to the lower elevations and snow to 
the mountains. As it departs there will be a temporary ridge move 
over the Pacific Northwest as another upper level trough drops out
of the Gulf of Alaska. Deterministic models begin to have 
placement and timing differences with the ECMWF deepening the next
upper level trough off over the eastern Pacific and a dry 
southwest flow while the GFS is more progressive with a zonal 
westerly flow coming off the Pacific and into the region. This 
leads the GFS to be more aggressive bringing precipitation back 
into the Washington Cascades late Thursday whereas the ECMWF 
maintains the ridge over the region due to the deeper eastern 
Pacific trough solution. This creates some uncertainty through the
Thursday and Friday periods. Ensemble models also show this 
differing solution so forecast confidence is low. However, models 
do agree that the eastern pacific trough will move inland over the
weekend with some subtle timing differences. ECMWF would have the
bulk of the precipitation arriving on Saturday while the GFS 
holds off until Saturday night and Sunday. NBM is leaning to the 
ECWMF solution of increasing precipitation late Friday night and 
Saturday. 91
