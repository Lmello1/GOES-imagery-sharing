.DISCUSSION...Dry and quiet conditions today will give way to a
series of upper level weather systems that will impact the region
through the week. The system tomorrow will produce mostly rain,
with higher elevation mountain snow also possible. An associated
cold front passage will also bring breezy west winds, especially
through the Cascade gaps and in the lower elevations. Another
system Tuesday and Wednesday will bring another round of rain and
mountain snow, however precipitation amounts are expected to be
lower. Near to below normal temperatures and higher RHs will
prevail through the week.
