.SHORT TERM...Tonight through Tuesday...Satellite and surface
observations showing mostly quiet and dry conditions this 
afternoon while a transient ridge passes over the region. Behind 
the ridge several bands of cirrus, associated with the next upper
trough, have started to spread across western WA and into
northwest OR.

Cloud cover is expected to increase again later this evening as an
upper trough slides down the western Canadian coastline. The 
upper trough and a surface cold front will push across the PacNW 
late tonight through tomorrow afternoon, increasing chances of 
rain and mountain snow in the process. A warm sector out ahead of 
the upper trough and cold front will spread into the forecast area
from the southwest tonight into early tomorrow morning. Snow 
levels will rise above 5kft-6kft across the northern half of the 
forecast area and above 6kft-7kft across the southern half of the 
forecast area by the afternoon, lowering to 4kft-5kft through the 
evening and overnight. Due to the timing of the frontal boundary 
and upper trough passage, peak precipitation production is 
expected to occur before the colder airmass settles into the 
region. This will result in mainly a cold rain falling across the 
mountain zones with snowfall possible along the higher peaks and 
crests. In the lower elevations, most locations are expected to 
see at least 0.1 inches of rain with the frontal boundary passage.
However, deterministic guidance and the HREF guidance suggest 
that rain shadowing directly east of the Cascades could result in 
the Kittitas valley, Yakima valley, western portions of the Basin,
and central OR missing out on any rainfall. Otherwise, mountain 
zones can expect 0.75 to 1 inch of precipitation; the Blue 
mountain foothills and southern Blues may see 0.25 to 0.5 inches, 
and portions of the Basin and Gorge could see 0.1 to 0.25 inches 
of rainfall. Westerly winds are expected to increase with the 
frontal passage tomorrow afternoon, and persist into the evening 
hours, especially in the Kittitas valley.

The upper trough will quickly exit into MT late tomorrow evening,
which will introduce a brief period of drier conditions across the
forecast area into Tuesday afternoon. By the late Tuesday
afternoon, the next upper trough will be will be sliding into the
PacNW from the northwest. Moisture will be a bit more lacking with
this system, resulting in lower precipitation amounts across much
of the region Tuesday into Wednesday. However, snow levels will be
starting out around 4.5kft by Tuesday afternoon, and steadily drop
to about 3.5kft into Wednesday morning. This will allow for more
productive snowfall down to at least 4.5kft Tuesday evening and
overnight, with 2 to 5 inches of snowfall possible above 4.5kft. 
Lower in elevation, most foothill locations could expect up to 
0.15 inches of rain during this system, while the Basin into 
Central OR will see generally less than 0.1 inches of rainfall.
Lastly, with the late arrival of this system, winds are expected
to be light through much of Tuesday, but will increase overnight
into Wednesday. 

Afternoon temperatures the next couple of days will be in the mid
40s to 50s...mid 30s to mid 40s in sheltered mountain areas;
Morning low temperatures will be in the 30s to lower 40s...20s to
lower 30s mountains. Lawhorn/82 

.LONG TERM...Wednesday through Sunday...An upper trough will
continue to move across the region on Wednesday. However, it will
be moving out of the forecast area by Wednesday afternoon with a
northwest flow moving in behind it. This will result in decreasing
precipitation chances from north to south through the day. The
precipitation will linger the longest over the Cascades
(especially the OR Cascades), and central OR northeast across the
eastern and northeast mountains. Snow levels will be steady 
through the day around 3500-4000 feet. This will result in snow 
over the mountains, with possibly a few inches of accumulation, 
mainly above 4000 feet (especially over the OR Cascades and the
east/northeast OR mountains). The combined snow totals prior to
12Z Wednesday and from 12Z through 00Z (during the day Wednesday)
could be enough to warrant some winter weather highlights.
However, it is too soon to to have high enough confidence to issue
any highlights at this time. There is some minor areas of ECMWF
EFI values above 0.6 for snow, but these areas are small. On the
other hand, the deterministic models are in good agreement with
the ensembles and with each other. Also, the cluster analysis for
day 3 (Wednesday) shows good consistency between the different
clusters, with all showing an upper trough located over eastern OR
and WA. 

A transitory tilted upper ridge will move across the forecast area
Wednesday night and Thursday resulting in a dry period during that
time. However, clouds and precipitation chances will increase
again from northwest to southeast beginning late Thursday
afternoon continuing through Friday night. POPs will be highest
over the Cascade crest and the upper east slopes, with likely POPs
there. Elsewhere, POPs will increase to mainly the chance 
category over all of the rest of the forecast area by Saturday. 
Snow levels during this time will increase to around 6000-7000 
feet over the OR Cascades to around 5000 feet over the WA Cascades
and around 6000 feet over Wallowa County. This will result in the
precipitation being mainly rain, except over the highest peaks 
and ridges...above pass levels. The precipitation is then expected
to persist mainly in the chance category through Sunday. Total 
QPF amounts from Thursday night through Sunday will be the 
greatest over the crest of the WA Cascades with upwards to 2-3 
inches. Elsewhere, 1-2 inches are expected over the OR Cascade 
crest, .5 to .75 of an inch over the northeast mountains, .1 to 
.3 of an inch over the Foothills, central OR north to the 
Yakima/Kittitas Valleys and the John Day Highlands. Precipitation 
amounts will be mainly less than a tenth of an in the Lower 
Columbia Basin of both OR and WA. 

Cluster analysis from day 4-6 (Thursday - Saturday) are still in
fairly good consistency between the different clusters, but then
they diverge on Day 7 (Sunday). Also, the deterministic models and
ensembles begin to have greater differences by Sunday as well.
Therefore, forecast confidence is fairly good through Saturday,
and then decreasing on Sunday. 

Winds will become breezy over the eastern Columbia Gorge, north
central OR, the Lower Columbia Basin of OR, and the southern Blue
Mountain Foothills on Wednesday afternoon and evening. Elsewhere,
winds will be mostly light on Wednesday. After Wednesday evening,
winds will become light in all areas, which will continue through
the rest of the long term forecast period. However, there may be 
locally breezy winds again Sunday afternoon in the aforementioned 
areas as Wednesday. 

Temperatures will remain cool, and below normal on Wednesday with
highs in the lower to mid 50s in the lowest elevations, and 30s
and 40s in the mountains. Then temperatures will warm about 4-6
degrees on Thursday, and a couple more degrees on Friday. After
that they will remain steady in the upper 50s to lower 60s in the
lowest elevations, and 40s and 50s in the mountains, which is
slightly above normal. 88

.AVIATION...Previous Discussion...18Z TAFs...VFR conditions will 
persist during the next 24 hours. There will be increasing clouds 
this afternoon and tonight as another weather system moves into 
the Pacific Northwest. Rain chances will increase late tonight and
early Monday morning. CIGs will lower to 050-070 by 12Z. Winds 
will be light most of the time, but may gust to 10-15 Kts at times
this afternoon and early evening, mainly at KDLS, KPSC, KALW and 
KPDT. 88
