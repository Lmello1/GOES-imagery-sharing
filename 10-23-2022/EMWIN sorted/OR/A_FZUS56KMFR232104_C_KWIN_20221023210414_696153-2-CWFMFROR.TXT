.SYNOPSIS FOR THE SOUTHERN OREGON COASTAL WATERS...The region is 
between weather systems this afternoon, but swell dominated seas 
will remain steep through this evening. The next front will 
approach the area late tonight and south winds will increase 
ahead of and with this front, resulting in another period of 
steep seas due to increased wind waves mixed with residual swell 
north of Cape Blanco. Winds ease Monday, but seas continue to 
build and become dominated by a high and steep swell Monday night 
into Tuesday. Another front will move onshore Tuesday. Seas will 
slightly subside Tuesday night, but another round of high and 
steep northwest swell is possible Wednesday. Active weather is 
expected to continue through next weekend, with a heavy, long 
period swell possible Friday.
