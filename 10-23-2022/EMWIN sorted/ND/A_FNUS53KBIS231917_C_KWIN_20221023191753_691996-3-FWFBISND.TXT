.DISCUSSION...

A potent low pressure system will bring strong winds and 
widespread precipitation to the region tonight through Monday. 
Precipitation will begin as rain in the west late this afternoon
before changing to snow tonight. Rain and a few thunderstorms are
likely across central North Dakota tonight, with precipitation 
becoming mixed or all snow by early Monday morning. A widespread 
wetting rain (including melting snow) is expected with this 
system for most of the area. Locations least likely to see a 
wetting rain are in far south central ND. The windiest conditions
will be tonight through Monday afternoon when northwest winds 
will sustain around 30 mph with gusts up to 50 mph. 

The rest of the upcoming week will feature mostly dry conditions 
with highs mainly in the upper 30s to the low 50s. The one 
exception is that there is a chance of rain, mainly in the south,
Wednesday night through the day Thursday.
