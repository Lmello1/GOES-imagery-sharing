Area Forecast Discussion

206 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

.SYNOPSIS...
A coastal low and its associated warm front will lead to rain 
overspreading coastal areas this morning, then reaching further
inland through the afternoon. More showers, locally heavy are 
expected tonight into Monday, as the front moves into the 
region. Above normal temperatures expected for much of the 
region during the week ahead, before cooling down Friday into 
this weekend. In addition, unsettled weather provides periods of
on and off rain through midweek. There still remains 
uncertainty Friday into next weekend.

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...

2 PM Update:

Ridge across northern New England and associated low to mid
level dry air over SNE, delaying northward progression of rain 
shield. This is evident on SPC mesoanalysis, indicating a super 
tight moisture gradient south to north in the 925 mb and 850 mb
theta-e fields. Nonetheless, the rain will eventually win out 
as the afternoon progresses, spreading northward with moderate 
to heavy rain at times toward sunset along the south coast, 
including Cape Cod and the Islands. Previous forecast captures 
these trends, thus no major changes with this update. Earlier 
discussion below. 

============================================================ 

Amplified upper trough along the mid Atlc region with 
subtropical ridge to the east will set up a southerly flow aloft
which will advect high PWAT plume northward into SNE. PWATs 
increase to 1.5- 1.75" in the coastal plain this afternoon which
is 200-250% of normal. PWATs approach 1.5" further in the 
interior toward evening. Low pres will meander off the mid Atlc 
coast with the inverted trough extending east of SNE. Developing
isentropic lift on the cool side of the boundary enhanced by a 
modest low level jet will bring rain northward into SNE today. 
There is plenty of low level dry air to overcome in the interior
so the rain will initially be focused near the SE New Eng coast
this morning through early afternoon before gradually spreading
further inland mid to late afternoon. It may take until late 
afternoon or early evening before rain reaches NW MA. The rain 
could be heavy at times this afternoon across SE MA and 
Cape/Islands as the low level jet lifts north into the region 
and forcing for ascent increases. 

Highs will reach upper 50s to lower 60s, but fall into the low/mid 
50s this afternoon as the rain overspreads the region. Gusty NE 
winds will develop this afternoon along the immediate south coast 
and Cape/Islands as the low level jet approaches.

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH 6 PM MONDAY/...

Tonight into Monday...

The low level warm front at 850 mb is expected to lift to the 
north this evening with winds turning southerly at 850 mb while 
NE winds persist at the surface at least through tonight. After 
the low level warm fropa, precip is expected to become more 
showery and scattered tonight and Monday. However, instability 
aloft increases with MUCAPES 200-400 J/kg and PWATs remain 
elevated at 1.5-1.75", so the risk for convective showers and 
isolated t-storms will increase. There is a signal in the hi-res
CAMs for showers/isolated t-storms with locally heavy rainfall 
lifting northward across SNE late tonight into Mon as a modest 
southerly low level jet develops. We are not expecting 
widespread rainfall but there will be periods of heavy showers 
and possible thunder that will impact some areas. The axis of 
heaviest rainfall is uncertain as the hi-res guidance differs on
the location. Can't rule out heavy rainfall in the interior but
we are leaning toward eastern New Eng where highest PWATs and 
better elevated instability overlap with nearby boundary. Total 
rainfall of 1-2 inches is possible in eastern New Eng with 
localized amounts exceeding 2 inches where heavy showers 
develop. Some localized urban and poor drainage street flooding 
is possible if the heavier showers materialize. 

Lows will range from upper 40s interior to mid 50s near the 
coast tonight. The inverted trough/warm front is expected to 
move west into the coastal plain Mon. Temps in the warm sector 
likely to spike into the upper 60s across portions of SE MA and
RI with dewpoints low/mid 60s. On the cool side of the 
boundary, temps will reach mid 50s to lower 60s.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...

Highlights...

* Unsettled weather and slightly warmer than normal temperatures are 
  the story this coming week.  

Tuesday through Thursday...

Tropical moisture that was advected north does come to an end early 
Tuesday, but the region is left with higher than normal PWATs 
because, there is no real forcing to move it away from southern New 
England. In fact, PWATs remain at or above normal, seen on the 
global ensembles through late week. Aloft there is not much 
happening as there is a mid-level trough to our west, this places 
southern New England on the edge of weak ridging. There are bouts of 
weak shortwave energy that ride the outer periphery of the ridge. It 
is that weak forcing which allows on and off scattered light rain 
Tuesday, Wednesday, and possibly Thursday. NHC continues to
watch a disturbance southeast of Bermuda, which is give a 20
percent chance of development over the next five days. Looking
at the latest global ensembles, the GEFS does not have much
guidance to support any significant development. The ENS does
brings several members towards the Benchmark 18z Wednesday.

Confidence during this part of the forecast does remain low, 
did not stray away from the NBM which has slight chance to 
chance POPs. 

As for temperatures, WWA brings in anonymously warm temperatures 
aloft, +13C to +16C at 925mb. As mentioned in previous discussions, 
if there were full sun this week, along with appropriate mixing in 
the boundary layer, surface temperatures would easily climb into the 
low and middle 70s! Despite the poor mixing in the PBL temperatures 
are still expected to be warmer than normal, day time highs Tuesday 
though Thursday are generally 65F to 70F. Dew point temperatures 
remains elevated as well, day time dew points in the low and middle 
60s and nighttime dew points in the upper 50s and low 60s. These 
higher nighttime dew points will aid in keeping nighttime low 
temperatures mild. Tuesday night and Wednesday night are warm with 
lows in the middle and upper 50s.

Thursday night into Friday morning there appears to be a change of 
air mass, most of the guidance supports dew points dropping into the 
upper 30s and lower 40s. 

Friday through Sunday...

As for Friday and the coming weekend, not much as really changed 
since the afternoon discussion. Models are suggesting high pressure 
builds in to our north and helps to bring in cooler air and drier 
conditions. However some models runs show another low over the 
Atlantic south of the area that may get close enough to give us 
clouds and rain. Stuck with the blend which features some 20-30 PoPs.
