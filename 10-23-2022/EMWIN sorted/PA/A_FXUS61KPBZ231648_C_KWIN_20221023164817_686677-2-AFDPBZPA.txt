1248 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

.SYNOPSIS...
Warm and dry weather can be expected until rain chances return during
the middle of the coming week.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
High pressure will maintain dry and warm conditions this
afternoon with daytime highs forecast around 10 degrees above 
normal across the region. Another night of clear skies and light
winds will lead to another large diurnal swing in temperatures.
Sheltered valleys and low lying areas will be much colder than 
ridges and urban areas.

&&

.SHORT TERM /MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...
Dry conditions and above normal temperatures will continue 
Monday and Tuesday before a shortwave and associated cold front
lift north across the region late Tuesday and Wednesday. 
Relatively light QPF is still expected as latest ensemble 
plumes indicate most likely rainfall from this feature of 
between 0.1 and 0.2 inches. &&

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
High pressure will build across the greater Great Lakes region 
on Thursday in wake of the front. Light northerlies will result 
in modest cold air advection, yielding slightly cooler and dry, 
seasonable weather by the end of the week and heading into the 
weekend.

&&

.AVIATION /18Z SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
VFR will prevail across all terminals for the next few days.
Elongated surface high pressure along the spine of the
Appalachians will result in light E-SE winds through the period. 

.Outlook...
The next chance for rain and possible restrictions comes
Wednesday with a quick-moving low pressure system.
