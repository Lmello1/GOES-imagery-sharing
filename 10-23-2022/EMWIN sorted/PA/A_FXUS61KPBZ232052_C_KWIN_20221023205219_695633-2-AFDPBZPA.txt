452 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

.SYNOPSIS...
Warm and dry weather can be expected until rain chances return
mid week.

&&

.NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM MONDAY MORNING/...
Clear skies and light wind will lead to another large diurnal 
swing in temperatures due to radiational cooling. Expect low
temperature near the climatological norm. 

&&

.SHORT TERM /6 AM MONDAY MORNING THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...
Dry conditions and above normal high temperature will continue 
Monday and Tuesday, on the periphery of broad troughing to our 
West. With the assistance of vorticity advection, low pressure 
undergoing cyclolysis will result in scattered precipitation 
chance beginning Wednesday.

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
Zonal flow and high pressure will begin to recover the airmass 
on Thursday, gradually clearing skies. 

Long range model ensembles indicate seasonable temperature to 
continue, with the next chance for precipitation being toward 
the end of the month, as low pressure is capable of moving in 
from the Plains. 

&&

.AVIATION /21Z SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
VFR will prevail as high pressure sits aloft. Winds will veer
sly, but no other pattern changes expected. 

Patchy peri-dawn fog is possible Monday AM as winds calm 
overnight and temperature cools, highest chance occurring in 
valleys.

.Outlook...
The next chance for rain and possible restrictions comes
Wednesday with a quick-moving low pressure system.
