Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Pittsburgh PA
143 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

.SYNOPSIS...
Warm and dry weather can be expected until rain chances return during
the middle of the coming week.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...
High pressure will maintain dry and warm conditions this
afternoon with daytime highs forecast around 10 degrees above 
normal across the region. Another night of clear skies and light
winds will lead to another large diurnal swing in temperatures.
Sheltered valleys and low lying areas will be much colder than 
ridges and urban areas.

&&

.SHORT TERM /MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...
Dry conditions and above normal temperatures will continue 
Monday and Tuesday before a shortwave and associated cold front
lift north across the region late Tuesday and Wednesday. 
Relatively light QPF is still expected as latest ensemble 
plumes indicate most likely rainfall from this feature of 
between 0.1 and 0.2 inches. &&

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
High pressure will build across the greater Great Lakes region 
on Thursday in wake of the front. Light northerlies will result 
in modest cold air advection, yielding slightly cooler and dry, 
seasonable weather by the end of the week and heading into the 
weekend.

&&

.AVIATION /18Z SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
Elongated surface high pressure along the spine of the 
Appalachians will result in VFR with light E-SE winds through 
the remainder of the day and early overnight hours. 

Late tonight, the high will shift overhead, calming winds 
locally. Dew points will be a few degrees higher than the night 
prior. The highest dew points are most likely for eastern ports 
as some at Atlantic moisture streams in around a coastal low. 
For these reasons, patchy fog is possible for the morning hours 
tomorrow. At this time; there is a high uncertainty in fog 
coverage and visibility with marginal moisture.

Any vis restrictions will quickly clear at daybreak and winds 
will veer more south-southwesterly with a reoriented pressure 
gradient.

.Outlook...
The next chance for rain and possible restrictions comes
Wednesday with a quick-moving low pressure system.
