.DISCUSSION...

Elevated Risk for Brush Fire Spread Continues this Afternoon. 

Winds remain gusty this afternoon up to 40 mph with occasional 
higher gusts possible through mid evening. While minimum RH values
are in the 40 to 50 percent range, the very dry fuel moistures 
(around 8 to 10 percent in spots) have created an elevated risk 
for brush fire spread.

An approaching storm system is expected to develop an area of 
showers and possible thunderstorms across the area late this 
evening and through the early overnight hours. Showers are 
expected to come to an end Monday morning which will lead to 
mostly dry and mild conditions once again. Winds will also be 
breezy on Monday, but with lighter gusts around 25 mph. A strong 
cold front will move through Monday night into the day on Tuesday 
which looks to bring some much needed rainfall to the area.
