Fire Weather Planning Forecast for Central/Southeast Illinois
National Weather Service Lincoln IL
242 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

.DISCUSSION...

Much of Monday will be dry, although still fairly breezy with
south winds gusting from 25 to 30 mph. Minimum humidity levels
south of I-70 will be between 30 and 40%, which combined with
the breezy conditions and dry fuels to result in a slightly 
elevated fire danger. 

Showers are expected to begin moving into areas near the 
Illinois River during the afternoon, then spreading eastward 
through Monday night. Widespread rain is on tap for Tuesday and 
Tuesday evening. Rainfall of over 2 inches is possible over the 
period, with the heaviest amounts currently expected to be centered 
along the I-55 corridor.
