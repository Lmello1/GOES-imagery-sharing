.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 414 AM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Continued dry regime dominated by upper and sfc ridging with only 
just some cirrus skirting across the area through today into 
tomorrow. Dewpoints and resultant RH values look to be higher than 
yesterday so not anticipating any fire danger concerns today. Max 
temps today should be right around climo norms with much of the area 
in the low to mid 70s, then warm up to a few degrees higher even for 
highs Monday at mainly the mid to upper 70s. Upper trough will be 
amplifying into the south Central Plains and the attendant sfc front 
approaching from the west will serve as the next main focus later 
Tuesday into Wednesday.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday night through Saturday)
Issued at 414 AM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Starting off the long term period on Tuesday, the ridging will 
dominate the SE CONUS for one more day before a pattern change 
comes. Temps will continue to gradually warm into the upper 70s to 
low 80s along with RHs trending upward.

To our west, a split flow begins to set up on Tuesday, with the 
southern branch swinging a closed off low through Texas and up into 
the mid MS valley, with a front extending southward.  This front 
will march eastward relatively quickly across the SE entering 
Georgia in the Tuesday overnight period. In previous discussions, 
we mentioned low CAPE values, and while that still holds true, the
shear values have increased (possibly giving us a high shear/low 
CAPE type situation) and could be conducive to isolated severe 
thunderstorms, mainly in NW Georgia at this time. There is still 
uncertainty when it comes to this event, but considering it is 
expected to be overnight, it doesn't hurt to keep an eye on the 
situation. Due to this, chance thunderstorms have been introduced
into the weather type for the overnight Tuesday period. Temps are
forecasted to decrease slightly with this front (upper 60s-low 
70s for max Temps and mid 40s for min temps), but no where near as
drastic a chance as the last FROPA. 

After this quick moving FROPA, SW flow sets up again gradually 
warming temps into the mid 70s for max Temps and mid 50s for min 
temps. Looking into next weekend another system looks to set up 
similar to what is expected Tuesday. There is still very little 
model agreement when it comes to the timing and positioning of 
this FROPA, but PoPs have been increased to slight chance through 
the weekend.
