.SHORT TERM...
(This afternoon through Monday)
Issued at 220 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

An upper level ridge continues to intensify over much of the 
Southeast CONUS. This and surface high pressure will be the main 
driver of the sensible weather pattern through the remainder of the 
day and Monday. With light, southeasterly low level winds, dewpoints 
will gradually increase from the mid to upper 40s into the 50s, 
which will keep relative humidity values outside of critical fire 
danger thresholds. Temperatures will gradually climb under the 
ridge, with afternoon highs mostly in the upper 70s today and upper 
70s to low 80s on Monday. An upper level trough currently positioned 
over the Rockies will amplifying as it moves into the southern 
Central plains tomorrow. A surface low and cold front associated 
with this trough will move into the Mississippi River Valley by 
early morning on Tuesday, which will serve as the next main focus 
for precipitation. Precipitation is thus not expected until the long 
term period.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday morning through next Saturday)
Issued at 220 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

The first chance for rainfall in quite some time will be returning 
at the start of the long term period. A southern stream cutoff low 
will be swinging east-northeastward across the Arklatex region into 
the Mid Mississippi Valley by late Tuesday, dragging a cold front 
eastward into our area. Showers and thunderstorms will develop along 
and ahead of the front across Mississippi and Alabama during the day 
Tuesday where a more substantial risk of strong to severe 
thunderstorms will reside. 

The front and associated convection approach Georgia by Tuesday 
evening into Tuesday night, at which point the warm sector will be 
dwindling. Thus, the threat for strong to severe thunderstorms 
locally currently appears very limited. However, an isolated 
strong/severe threat could linger at least initially during the 
evening during which time low-end CAPE lingers alongside favorable 
shear before coverage diminishes with eastward extent Tuesday night 
into Wednesday morning. Unfortunately, for those wanting substantial 
relief from the extended dry conditions, QPF with this system is on 
the lighter side. Rainfall totals broadly appear to remain a quarter 
inch or less with locally higher totals in northwest Georgia and 
scant amounts in the southeast half of the area.

A brief shot of slightly cooler air returns behind the front 
Wednesday with a gradual warming trend commencing thereafter as 
southwest flow returns. More active weather looks more likely to 
return by next weekend as another southern stream system approaches, 
but model disagreement on evolution remains. Thus, at this point 
PoPs trend gradually higher by Saturday.

(18Z TAFS)

cirrus coverage. Winds through the remainder of the afternoon
will be E to SE at 3-6 kts, becoming light and variable overnight,
then E to SE at 4-7 kts after 15Z on Monday.
