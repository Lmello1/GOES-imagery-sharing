.SYNOPSIS FOR THE TIDAL POTOMAC AND MD PORTION OF THE CHESAPEAKE BAY...

A coastal low pressure system will move along the western Atlantic 
through Monday before sliding offshore. High pressure returns during
 the early to middle portions of the week. A frontal system crosses 
through the region by Wednesday. Behind this cold front, high 
pressure builds over the Great Lakes into New England by late in the
 week.
