.DISCUSSION...
Issued at 250 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Upper level ridge and surface high pressure should prevail until 
Tuesday, supporting quiet and stable conditions over land areas.
As a result, expect sunny with a few/sct clouds for the next days as 
RH values will keep gradually increasing. On Wednesday, a weak cold 
front is expected to approach from the west and winds could shift 
westerly and more variable inland. Due to the dry air established 
ahead of the boundary, not much rain is expected with the frontal 
passage. There will be a chance for isolated showers. 

For next weekend, another upper wave is possible to develop, 
increasing chances for rain somewhat for the weekend. However,
at this moment, ensemble guidance have uncertainty with the 
trajectory and timing of this system. 

Highs for tomorrow are forecast to be in the mid 80s, with overnight 
lows in the mid 50s north to the mid 60s south. Then, temperatures 
should remain more consistent for the rest of the forecast period, 
reaching the mid 80s with lows in the 60s.

.MARINE...
Issued at 250 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Scattered clouds and rain free over the coastal waters as surface 
high pressure continues to ridge. Recent data from the surrounding 
buoys suggest winds from the north/northeast at 5 to 15 knots, an 
easterly flow shift is anticipated for tomorrow and Tuesday. Then, 
by mid week, a weak front is expected to approach from the west and 
winds could shift westerly with isolated showers possible. Wave 
height forecast to remain between 1 to 3 feet through the forecast 
period.

Issued at 250 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Moisture will continue to increase, keeping RH values above critical 
levels the rest of the forecast period. Northeasterly winds should 
remain in place today, becoming easterly tomorrow. No fire weather 
concerns through the forecast period.
