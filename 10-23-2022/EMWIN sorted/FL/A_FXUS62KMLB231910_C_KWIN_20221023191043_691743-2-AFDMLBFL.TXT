.DISCUSSION...

Current/Tonight...Dry airmass continues over east central FL with
PWATS ranging from around .75 inches across nrn Lake/Volusia
counties to 1.1 inches across southern Martin. Current light
shower activity over the Atlantic is forecast to inch toward the
coast later tonight. Will continue a slight chance for a late 
night light coastal shower from the southern Brevard barriers 
islands to the Treasure Coast. Most areas will remain dry and cool
with lows ranging from the upper 50s across cooler interior 
locations of Lake and Volusia county to the upper 60s along 
portions of the Treasure Coast. 

Monday...The surface ridge over GA will shift eastward toward the
SE Atlantic coast with low level flowing veering to the NE/ENE.
Slightly higher moisture levels across southern sections may
support some morning isolated showers across the Treasure coast.
The remainder of the area should be dry. Highs will range from the
lower 80s coastal to 83-85 across the interior.

Monday Night-Wednesday...Mid-upper level ridging over the GOMEX 
shifts eastward towards Florida in response to a substantial trough 
over the central US digging southward towards Texas and progressing 
eastward. The aforementioned ridge amplifies over Florida as it gets 
pinched between the trough approaching from the west and a broad 
area of low pressure off the Atlantic seaboard to the east, keeping 
conditions mostly dry through Tuesday. By early Wednesday, the 
trough over the CONUS lifts north of the the southeast US, and flow 
aloft becomes zonal. With the loss of upper level support, the front 
associated with the trough is expected move through Florida with 
little fanfare on Wednesday. Southwesterly winds freshen ahead of 
the front Wednesday, but otherwise the pressure gradient remains 
loose and winds light. A few showers moving onshore will be possible 
with weak easterly flow Tuesday, but rain chances only around 10 
pct. Afternoon highs Tuesday in the mid 80s inland and low 80s along 
the coast, and mid 80s areawide Wednesday. Overnight lows in the 
upper 50s to around 60 north of I-4, low to mid 60s southward and 
inland, and low to mid 60s along the coast.

Thursday-Sunday...The front washes out Thursday, but still manages 
to reinforce dry conditions, keeping rain chances remain out of the 
forecast through the end of the week. Way out in the extended range, 
global models in pretty good agreement of a robust mid level 
trough/low pressure system developing over Texas late Friday or 
early Saturday, developing a surface low, and lifting northeast 
Sunday. This will likely lift the washed out front, hanging out 
somewhere near South Florida or the southern parts of the forecast 
area, back northward as a warm front, bringing 20 pct chance of rain 
back to the forecast Saturday. However, differences between models 
leave a pretty big question mark beyond Saturday, so have kept PoPs 
mainly around 20 pct Sunday as well. Afternoon highs in the mid 80s, 
and overnight lows in the 60s.

.MARINE...
Issued at 310 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Tonight...Pressure gradient will support winds around 15 knots
from the N initially veering to the NNE/NE later tonight. Will
continue SCEC for the offshore waters and gulf stream waters
overnight.

Monday-Thursday...Poor to hazardous boating conditions, mainly in
the Gulf Stream, expected to continue through Monday. Weak 
surface high pressure builds along the southeastern US Atlantic 
coast as the broad low pressure east of the local Atlantic waters 
lifts northward. Mainly dry conditions, but isolated showers will 
be possible. Winds NE 10-15 kts Monday become N-NE 5-10 kts by 
Tuesday evening as the pressure gradient loosens, then veer to SW 
around 10 kts Tuesday night ahead of a frontal passage Wednesday 
and Wednesday night. Winds become light and variable Thursday. 
Seas 4-5 feet in the nearshore and 4-6 feet offshore Monday 
subside to 3-4 feet Tuesday, and 2-3 feet Wednesday and Thursday.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 310 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Mainly VFR conds continue the next 24 hrs. An inverted trough will
bring a slight shower chance mainly to the KVRB-KSUA corridor 
later tonight into Mon morning, have added VCSH. Guid for fog 
prospects appears limited tonight, but there is chance for some 
MVFR fog from mainly 10z-12z for interior terminals late tonight 
with light winds and mainly clear skies.

Northerly winds are expected to slow the decline, keeping the 
river in well within Moderate Flood Stage all this week.

Near Deland, the river will remain in Major Flood Stage early 
this week. The river is currently at 5.5 feet and is forecast to 
very slowly decline to Moderate Flood stage around Tuesday.

Near Sanford, the river will remain in Moderate Flood Stage
through this week. The river is currently at 7.80 feet and is 
forecast to continue a slow decline.
