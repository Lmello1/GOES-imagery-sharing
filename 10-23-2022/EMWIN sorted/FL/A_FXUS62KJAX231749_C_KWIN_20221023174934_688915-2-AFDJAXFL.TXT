(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 138 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

VFR conditions will prevail at the regional terminals through at 
least 05Z. MVFR visibilities are expected to develop at VQQ around
06Z, with conditions then deteriorating to LIFR by 09Z. MVFR 
visibilities are also likely to develop at GNV and JAX towards 
09Z, with conditions likely deteriorating to IFR by 10Z. Periods 
of MVFR visibilities will also be possible around sunrise at CRG. 
VFR conditions are expected to prevail at the regional terminals
by 14Z. Northeasterly surface winds will remain sustained at 10-15
knots at the SGJ and SSI coastal terminals through around 22Z,
while sustained surface speeds remain in the 5-10 knot range at
the inland terminals. Winds will quickly diminish by 00Z at the 
regional terminals, with light northwesterly winds sustained at 5 
knots or less developing at the coastal terminals after 06Z.
Northeasterly surface winds sustained around 5 knots will then
resume at the inland terminals before 15Z Monday, while speeds 
increase to around 10 knots at the coastal terminals.

.UPDATE...
Issued at 1010 AM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Late morning surface analysis depicts low pressure (1010
millibars) situated off the southeastern seaboard, with 
troughing extending southwest of this feature along the Gulf 
Stream waters adjacent to the northeast FL coast. Otherwise, 
strong high pressure (1030 millibars) stretches from the Canadian 
Maritime region and southward down the spine of the Appalachians. 
Aloft...troughing off the southeastern seaboard was lifting 
northward, allowing for ridging centered over the Bay of Campeche 
to expand northeastward towards the northern Gulf coast. A few 
patches of stratocumulus were located across inland sections of 
southeast GA, with fair skies otherwise prevailing throughout our 
region. Temperatures at 14Z were climbing through the 60s across 
our area, with dewpoints mostly ranging from the upper 40s to the 
mid 50s, except around 60 along the northeast FL coast from St. 
Augustine southward. 

Low pressure off the southeastern seaboard will pivot northward
towards the North Carolina Outer Banks later today and tonight,
with an associated trough extending southwestward from this
system weakening over the Gulf Stream waters this afternoon and
then gradually dissipating overnight. This weather pattern will
allow weak surface ridging to become established over the
southeastern states from this afternoon through Monday night. A
few stratocumulus clouds associated with the weakening trough
offshore may brush the northeast FL coast this afternoon.
Otherwise, mostly sunny skies, a lingering dry air mass and slowly
rising heights aloft will allow inland highs to climb into the
lower 80s this afternoon, while breezy north-northeasterly winds
at coastal locations keep highs in the mid to upper 70s. 

Patchy fog will be possible at inland locations by the predawn 
hours on Monday, with thin cirrus expected to increase in coverage
over our skies tonight as the periphery of ridging aloft builds 
into our region from the southwest. Radiational cooling will 
otherwise result in lows falling to the upper 40s for inland 
locations north of the I-10 corridor, with 50s elsewhere, except 
around 60 along the northeast FL coast. Heights aloft will
continue to slowly rise on Monday, with a loosening local pressure
gradient and a dry air mass resulting in highs at inland locations
rising to the lower 80s again, except a few middle 80s possible in
the Suwannee Valley and north central FL. Breezy onshore winds on
Monday afternoon will again keep coastal highs mostly in the upper
70s.

.MARINE...
Issued at 1010 AM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Weak low pressure situated off the southeastern seaboard will move
northward towards the North Carolina Outer Banks tonight and will
then parallel the Mid-Atlantic and New England coasts through
midweek. Breezy northerly winds will prevail over our local waters
today, with seas remaining elevated at Caution levels of 4-6 feet
offshore through tonight, with 3-5 foot seas prevailing near shore.
Meanwhile, high pressure will gradually weaken as it settles over
our local waters on Monday and Tuesday, allowing for winds and 
seas to subside. Otherwise, low pressure will strengthen over the 
Ozarks on Monday night and will then accelerate northeastward 
towards the eastern Great Lakes towards midweek, pushing a 
weakening cold front into the southeastern states on Tuesday 
night. Only isolated showers and thunderstorms are expected during
this frontal passage across our local waters on Wednesday 
afternoon and evening. 

Rip Current Risk: Breezy north-northeasterly winds and elevated
wave heights will create a high rip current risk at the St. Johns
and Flagler County beaches this afternoon, with a moderate risk
expected elsewhere. A long period northeasterly swell will combine
with breezy onshore winds on Monday afternoon, resulting in a
moderate risk at all area beaches.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 1010 AM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

North-northeasterly surface and transport winds will remain breezy
along the Interstate 95 corridor today, where fair to good
dispersion values are forecast this afternoon. Lighter speeds
inland will generally result in poor to fair values. Otherwise, a
dry air mass will prevail for locations west of the U.S. Highway
301 corridor this afternoon, where minimum relative humidity
values will fall to around 35 percent. Northeasterly transport 
winds will diminish slightly on Monday, while breezy surface winds
develop at coastal locations during the afternoon hours.
Marginally low daytime dispersion values are forecast for inland
locations along and north of the I-10 corridor, where poor values
are expected elsewhere. A dry air mass is expected at all inland
locations, where minimum relative humidity values on Monday
afternoon will fall to 30-35 percent.

.HYDROLOGY...
Issued at 1010 AM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Breezy north-northeasterly winds are resulting in trapped tides
within the St. Johns River basin, where water levels may briefly
approach minor flood levels around times of high tide through
midweek. Water levels of 1-1.5 feet above Mean Higher High Water
will be possible around times of high tide, especially for
locations south of downtown Jacksonville within the St. Johns
River basin.
