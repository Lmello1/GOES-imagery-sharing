.UPDATE...
Issued at 814 AM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

A few isolated showers have been observed along the Palm Beach
coast this morning, and will likely continue for the next few
hours. Bumped up PoPs a tad over this area but kept them below
15%. Also increased SKY cover this afternoon to account for SCT Cu
that will likely develop during peak heating. Only minor tweaks
were made to the other grids. Overall still looking at a nice day
across South Florida with afternoon highs generally in the middle
80s, with some upper 80s across the Interior.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 248 AM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

A mid-level low cut off from the greater flow aloft will continue to 
move northward towards the Carolinas from the northwestern Bahamas 
today. This will allow a reinforcement of drier air to settle over 
southern Florida today that will linger into Monday. With that drier 
air will come limited convective coverage and more abundant sunshine 
which means the warming trend will continue with most areas reaching 
well into the 80s by this afternoon. Overnight lows will also warm 
with 60s across most of the southern peninsula and 70s sneaking back 
in along the coast.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Monday night through Saturday)
Issued at 248 AM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Come Tuesday, another mid-level disturbance will emerge off the 
Bahamas over the Atlantic. To the northwest, a mid-level low will
be coincident with the southern portion of a cold front emanating
from low pressure over Canada. South Florida's stay under the 
influence of drier air will start to be pinched as the front 
approaches late Tuesday into Wednesday but the departure of the 
mid-level support northward into the Ohio River valley will cause 
some deterioration to the strength of the front. 

By the time the boundary arrives late Wednesday into Thursday, the 
lack of support will lead to a weak front that could stall over the 
region on Thursday. On Friday, some drier air is on the horizon 
ahead of the next system which will initially be driven by a mid-
level low cutting off from an amplified longwave trough that will 
drive surface low pressure development over the region between the 
northern Gulf coast and Interstate 20. Temperatures will continue to 
trend warmer ahead of this next front with highs in the mid to upper 
80s not out of the question by the end of the week.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 107 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

VFR through the 18Z TAF period. Few to Sct Cu this afternoon with
NE winds around 10 kts. Some isolated showers are possible but
chances are too low to mention at any of the terminals. Winds
become light and variable late tonight.

&&

.MARINE...
Issued at 248 AM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

As the mid-level low moves north towards the Carolinas and mid-
Atlantic, conditions over the Atlantic waters will improve with 
winds easing and seas diminishing. The potential for showers and 
thunderstorms remains focused over the Atlantic waters for much of 
the period which could lead to some locally hazardous conditions as 
well.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 248 AM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

A high risk for rip currents continues along the Palm Beaches,
while an elevated rip current risk lingers along the Atlantic 
beaches into the work week. The Palm Beaches appear to have the 
highest risk but rip current statements may need to be expanded 
into the Broward and/or Miami-Dade beaches as well.
