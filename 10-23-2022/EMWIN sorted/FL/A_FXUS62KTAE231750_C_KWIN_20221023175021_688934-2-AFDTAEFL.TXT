.NEAR TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 355 AM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

A mid to upper level low off the southeast coast will continue to 
lift northward today as ridging strengthens across the southeast. 
High pressure will also continue to dominate at the surface. Expect 
dry conditions through tonight, with the potential for patch fog to 
develop across the far eastern portion of southwest Georgia early 
tomorrow morning. The warming trend will continue today as the upper 
level ridge builds in. Expect highs in the upper 70s to lower 80s 
and lows in the 50s.

.SHORT TERM...
(Monday through Tuesday night)
Issued at 355 AM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Unseasonably warm conditions define the short-term thanks an 
amplifying ridge axis extending from the Gulf into the southeast US 
with surface high pressure centered over the Carolinas. Modeled 500-
mb heights of 5880 m continue to be depicted across the service area 
on Monday, which are near record daily values. Therefore, the high 
temperature forecast again went with NBM 75th percentile (widespread 
low to mid 80s) under mostly sunny skies. Convergent easterly flow 
may spark a few offshore showers Monday morning while patchy fog 
could be present over the I-75 corridor around sunrise. Overnight 
lows are forecast to be mostly in the 50s.

On Tuesday, muggy air off the Gulf surges inland as flow turns 
southeasterly ahead of an approaching cold front and attendant 
energetic shortwave trough/surface low. Dew points respond by 
rising into the 60s by the afternoon. Low-end rain chances are 
confined mostly off the Emerald Coast in the morning, then 
increase slightly over the western FL Panhandle and southeast AL 
later that afternoon when the front knocks on our door. The 
weakening ridge of high pressure combined with increased cloud 
cover knocks down daytime high by a couple degrees. Patchy fog is 
possible across the I-75 corridor and southeast Big Bend Tuesday 
morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Saturday)
Issued at 355 AM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

The aforementioned shortwave makes its closest approach Tuesday 
evening, with models initially centering the system over northern 
MS/AL, then quickly lifting northeast into the TN Valley. As this 
evolution occurs, the attendant cold front sweeps through the 
service area and is likely to be accompanied by band of 
showers/thunderstorms. The pre-frontal environment will be decently 
moist, moderately unstable, and somewhat sheared. However, the 
fleeting upper-level support during the nighttime hours may keep 
robust convection fairly tamed. That said, a few strong or a couple 
briefly severe storms cannot be ruled out late Tuesday into 
Wednesday afternoon. A Marginal Risk (level 1 of 5) for severe 
weather was introduced in the Day 3 Outlook for the Deep South with 
the easternmost portion of the risk area just west of us. Trends 
will be monitored to see if any eastward extensions are necessary in 
subsequent outlooks. Damaging wind gusts would be main threat.

Post-frontal conditions are on tap for us late Wednesday as a 
relatively dry airmass temporarily returns. Another shortwave trough 
swings down into the southern Plains heading into next weekend and 
looks to bring another round of showers/storms around the end of 
this period. High temperatures are forecast to range from the upper 
70s to low 80s while overnight lows drop to the 50s (isolated low 
60s).

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 140 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

VFR conditions are expected to prevail, a brief period of patchy
fog is possible in and/or around terminals VLD/TLH/DHN tomorrow 
morning around sunrise. Confidence is low on the extent of fog 
coverage.

.MARINE...
Issued at 355 AM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

East winds 10 to 15 knots and 2 to 3 foot seas prevail the next 48 
hours with a slight chance of showers on Monday morning. On Tuesday, 
winds switch out of the southeast ahead of a cold front. Showers and 
thunderstorms are possible across the western waters before 
increasing eastward overnight when winds turn more southerly. The 
front exits our waters Wednesday afternoon and brings about westerly 
winds around 15 knots or less in its wake.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 355 AM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

While RH values will trend upward across most of the area today 
compared to yesterday, values in the 20 percent range will still 
remain possible, particularly across southeast Alabama. Winds will 
remain light today and tomorrow. Chances for rain return to the 
forecast for Tuesday and Wednesday. Low dispersion values are 
possible today across the tri-state area and tomorrow across 
portions of the Florida Big Bend and southwest Georgia. Patchy fog 
is possible Monday morning.

.HYDROLOGY...
Issued at 355 AM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Two frontal systems bring us returning rain chances late Tuesday 
into Wednesday and next weekend. However, the antecedent dry 
conditions and progressive nature of the first front should 
preclude flooding concerns. The latest 7-day QPF has amounts 
generally less than a quarter-inch with up to around 1" along the 
Forgotten Coast.
