.NEAR TERM...
(Through Monday)
Issued at 324 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Through tomorrow we'll remain under the ridge axis which will result 
in one more day of fair weather as we begin our transition ahead of 
the next cold front. PWATs across the area remain under 1 inch 
throughout the near term, which contributes to the fair weather. The 
western half of our Gulf waters may see some moisture return 
throughout tomorrow afternoon break over 1 inch for PWATs, which is 
why our best (and only) PoPs tomorrow are located there. Otherwise, 
inland we'll see upper level clouds filter into the region tomorrow 
as the cold front and it's associated shortwave make their approach. 
With easterly to southeasterly flow tomorrow, moisture will slowly 
filter into the region. Thus, our chances for brief patchy fog just 
before sunrise will increase, albeit confidence is currently low for 
tomorrow on the extent for patchy fog, if any.

Daytime highs are expected to be in the low to mid 80s with 
overnight lows in the low to mid 50s.

.SHORT TERM...
(Monday night through Tuesday night)
Issued at 324 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Upper level ridge axis over the region on Monday night will break 
down and move east as large upper level trough translates east 
through the deep south. By Tuesday night, this feature will be 
lifting north of the Tennessee Valley. Associated with this upper
level trough will be a cold front draped across the deep south. 
As this feature nears the region, southerly flow will strengthen 
quickly Tuesday through the afternoon as the cold front begins to 
near western portions of Alabama. Despite the impressive upper 
level support for this feature, limited time for moisture 
advection, especially across the central and eastern parts of the 
forecast area, and the quick northeast movement of the upper level
trough on Tuesday night will likely mean whatever line of storms 
that develops along the cold front will likely begin to break up 
as it moves into southeast Alabama and the eastern FL Panhandle 
early Wednesday morning. While the severe threat will lessen 
quickly with eastern extent overnight Tuesday into early 
Wednesday, there is at least support for isolated strong/severe 
storms overnight given the shear profiles and modest instability 
in place from strong southerly flow in the afternoon. 

These trends in severe chances are also reflected in rain chances
with 30 to 40 POPs across southeast Alabama and the Florida
Panhandle decreasing to 10 to 20 percent across the Big Bend and
southwest Georgia into early Wednesday. Warm conditions are
expected Tuesday with highs in the lower 80s. 

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Wednesday through Saturday)
Issued at 324 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

The cold front fully passes through the region by Wednesday
morning with any rain showers/storms quickly decreasing in
coverage by the time the front reaches the southeast Big Bend. Dry
and warm conditions are expected through the end of the week with
high temperatures climbing into the mid 80s by Friday ahead of our
next potential system over the upcoming weekend. For now, details
are fairly uncertain with large spread in guidance over the
upcoming weekend.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 324 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

VFR conditions are expected to prevail, a brief period of patchy fog 
is possible in and/or around terminals VLD/TLH/DHN tomorrow morning 
around sunrise. Confidence is low on the extent of fog coverage.

&&

.MARINE...
Issued at 324 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Easterly flow today will transition to southerly flow by Tuesday
ahead of a cold front that moves through Tuesday night into
Wednesday. Brief period of cautionary conditions is possible on
Tuesday/Wednesday before lighter winds/seas move in for the end of
the week. A potential increase in winds and seas is possible again
over next weekend but there is large uncertainty for when our next
system could arrive.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 324 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

RH values will continue to increase as expected into Monday, 
entering the 30-40% range across Alabama and Georgia with RH values 
in our Florida counties ranging from 40% inland to 60% closer to the 
coast. Low dispersion values are expected Monday and will increase 
into Wednesday. Patchy fog will be possible Monday morning along the 
I-75 corridor as well as Tuesday morning spanning from coastal 
regions west of Apalachee Bay to areas southeast of I-65. Late 
Tuesday into Wednesday, a frontal system is expected to push through 
the area with the chances of a wetting rain continuing to remain 
low. 

&&

.HYDROLOGY...
Issued at 355 AM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Two frontal systems bring us returning rain chances late Tuesday 
into Wednesday and next weekend. However, the antecedent dry 
conditions and progressive nature of the first front should 
preclude flooding concerns. The latest 7-day QPF has amounts 
generally less than a quarter-inch with up to around 1" along the 
Forgotten Coast.
