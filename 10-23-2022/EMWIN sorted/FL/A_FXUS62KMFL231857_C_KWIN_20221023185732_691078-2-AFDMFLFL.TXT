.SHORT TERM...
(Rest of today through Monday)
Issued at 241 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Afternoon analysis shows surface high pressure over the SE US, and 
weak low pressure off the Mid-Atlantic coast. At the upper levels, 
there is high pressure over the western Gulf with weak ridging that 
extends up into the southeast US. There is a weak wave associated 
with the surface low off the Mid-Atlantic, and another weak wave 
over the Caribbean. Overall it's another nice day across South 
Florida with plenty of sunshine and seasonably warm conditions. 
There's enough low level moisture with the weak waves to our east to 
squeak out some isolated showers mainly over the Atlantic waters, 
although some brief showers can't be ruled out along the east coast. 
It will be a milder night but still slightly below normal with lows 
in the lower 70s across the east coast metro, and mid to upper 60s 
elsewhere. 

Some weak upper level energy moves across South Florida on Monday, 
and latest CAMS are in decent agreement that some widely scattered 
showers are possible beginning in the morning across the east coast 
metro and then shifting westward over the Interior and Gulf coast 
during the afternoon into early evening. Increased PoPs but still 
held below 15% for this forecast cycle. Afternoon high temps will 
range from the low to middle 80s across the east coast metro and up 
around the lake, to upper 80s over Collier and the southern
Glades.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday night through next Saturday)
Issued at 241 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

South Florida will be between an amplifying mid level trough over
the western Atlantic, and a deep layer area of low pressure over 
the Midwest. Mid level ridging over the region will gradually 
flatten as the strong area of low pressure pushes northeastward 
towards the Ohio Valley and into the northeast by the middle of 
the week. This will result in mainly dry conditions across the 
region through the middle of the week, however, a brief passing 
shower or two cannot be ruled out from time to time over the 
Atlantic waters and the east coast along the northeasterly wind 
flow. High temperatures through the middle of the week will 
generally remain in the mid to upper 80s across most of South 
Florida. 

Moving into the end of the week, as the mid level ridge over the
region continues to flatten, a weakening frontal boundary
associated with the area of low pressure moving through the
Northeast and into the Canadian Maritimes will be pushing through
the Florida Peninsula. This frontal boundary will have very little
in the way of moisture to work with as it moves closer to the
region. The latest model guidance shows this front stalling out
somewhere over South Florida Thursday into Friday before
eventually dissipating. While many areas will remain dry during
this time frame due to the lack of moisture, a brief passing
shower cannot be completely ruled out in some spots during this
time frame. High temperatures will continue to remain in the mid
to upper 80s across South Florida through the end of the week.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 107 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

VFR through the 18Z TAF period. Few to Sct Cu this afternoon with
NE winds around 10 kts. Some isolated showers are possible but
chances are too low to mention at any of the terminals. Winds
become light and variable late tonight.

&&

.MARINE...
Issued at 241 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Increasing N/NE swell associated with a system off the Mid-Atlantic 
coast will result in seas building to 3-5 ft off Palm Beach late 
tonight through Monday, with seas 2-4 ft over the remainder of the 
Atlantic waters. Seas subside late Monday into Tuesday as the system 
advances up towards the northeast. Gulf waters will remain 2 feet or 
less through mid week. Scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms 
remain possible over the Atlantic waters through early this week, 
which could also lead to locally hazardous conditions.

.BEACHES...
Issued at 241 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

A high risk of rip currents remains for the Palm Beaches at least 
through Monday, with an elevated risk for the remainder of the 
Atlantic beaches. Elevated high tide cycles are expected this 
upcoming week, and guidance suggests this could lead to some minor 
coastal flooding along the Atlantic coast.
