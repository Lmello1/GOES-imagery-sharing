.NEAR TERM...
(Through Tonight)
Issued at 203 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

High pressure ridge will be over the region through Tonight. A weak
trough to the east of the area this afternoon, will move to the 
south of the area this evening. The combination of low 
level moisture, and light winds will result in fog formation 
overnight. Patchy to areal coverage is expected, with the potential 
for this fog to become dense. 

Lows Tonight will range from the lower 50s inland, to the lower 60s 
coast.

.SHORT TERM...
(Monday through Thursday) 
Issued at 203 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

High pressure ridge will remain over the area Monday into Monday 
night, with this ridge moving off to the east northeast Tuesday into
Tuesday night. Due to subsidence under high, dry weather will 
persist Monday into Tuesday, with mainly clear skies. Low level 
moisture, and light winds will provide the potential for fog again
Monday night and Tuesday night. 

A cold front will move east southeast across the area Wednesday into
Wednesday night. Moisture is somewhat lacking with this boundary, 
but enough to warrant chances for showers and a few thunderstorms as
boundary passes through. 

High pressure will build to the north Thursday, with a dry day under
mainly clear skies expected. 

Temperatures will trend near to a little above normal this period.

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday night through next Sunday) 
Issued at 203 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

High pressure ridge will extend south into area Thursday night 
through Friday. Dry weather will persist into Friday. 

A low pressure system will move across the Gulf coast and affect the
region next weekend. The combination of moisture from the northeast
wrapping around the high, and moisture ahead of the Gulf low, will 
result in chances for weekend showers and thunderstorms. 

Temperatures this period will trend a little above normal.
