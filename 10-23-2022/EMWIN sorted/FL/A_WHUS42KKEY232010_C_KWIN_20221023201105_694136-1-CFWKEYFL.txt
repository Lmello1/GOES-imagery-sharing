...COASTAL FLOOD STATEMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT...

* WHAT...Minor saltwater flooding during times of high tide.

* WHERE...Bayside communities of the Upper Keys, and the Middle
  Keys.

* WHEN...Through early Monday morning.

* IMPACTS...Minor saltwater flooding of low elevation streets and
  lots is likely. Some storm drains will overflow, and some
  seawalls and docks will be overtopped. Boaters can expect less
  clearance under fixed bridges. Motorists should remember that
  persistent puddles around the times of high tide are almost
  certain to contain a mix of saltwater.
