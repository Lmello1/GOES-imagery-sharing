.DISCUSSION...
This afternoon through Monday night...

Only change to going winter highlites will be to cancel the
advisory for the Beartooth and Red Lodge foothills. This area has
remained wind shadowed and any snow this afternoon into this
evening will be light. Where snow does fall expect slick road
conditions into tomorrow morning. 

Upper level low is still sitting along the SE ID/SW MT state line
area early this afternoon, maybe a bit slower to progress eastward
than models anticipated. But its still on track into NC Wyoming by
this evening and then into the Dakotas by tomorrow morning.
Precipitation amounts and snow accumulations haven't changed much
for tonight. We are seeing snow sticking already this afternoon in
the higher hills of Yellowstone, Sheridan, Big Horn, Treasure, and
Rosebud counties per web cams. This too is a bit earlier (3-6 
hours) than models anticipated. So far MTDOT only showing road
impacts in the western valleys (Paradise and Shields). As the sun
sets expect road conditions to deteriorate through the evening
hours where precipitation is falling. Models continue to show
hefty wind gusts across the forecast area tonight through at least
the first half of Monday, though they may remain gusty over
eastern areas through Monday evening. Where these strong gusts
(35-55 mph) intersect falling snow, visibility will be seriously
reduced. Strong winds combined with snow, slick roads, and poor
visibility will make travel difficult and discouraged tonight 
over SE MT and NC WY. Check DOT road conditions before heading out
and be prepared for difficult winter travel conditions (have a
winter survival kit in the vehicle).

Precipitation chances will diminish from west to east overnight
tonight, with early morning snow holding on along the eastern
state line until maybe 9 or 10 am. Expect some slick roads 
across the area Monday morning, especially east and south of
Billings as temperatures drop into the 20s for most of the area
tonight. 

Another disturbance pushes in from the west late in the day
Monday bringing additional rain/snow chances to the western 
mountains and foothills through Monday night. Highs Monday
afternoon will range from the upper 30s east to the lower 50s
west. Chambers


Tuesday through Sunday...

Remnants of a weak shortwave lingers into Tuesday to keep light
snow occurring in the mountains, but keeping the lower elevations
dry. Skies should clear behind it to allow temps to climb into the
upper 40s to low 50s, which will consistently be the highs
throughout the week, with maybe slightly warmer temperatures for
the weekend. Although weak zonal flow takes over Tuesday night,
another upper trough is progged to cross the northern rockies
late Wednesday into Thursday. However, its looks to swiftly move
south to the 4 corners regions and bring it's dynamic forcing and
moisture with it. Hence, again only the mountains look to receive
snow from this system, with an easy few inches of snow expected on
southwest and west facing slopes. There is only a small chance for
the foothills, mainly around Livingston and over in Sheridan
County, WY, to receive some light rain/snow mix from it. 

Immediately following this troughs departure is high pressure
sitting over Yellowstone and bringing about a tight pressure
gradient that will incur breezy gap winds to the Livingston area
Thursday evening through Friday morning.

.AVIATION...

While flight conditions will slowly improves for terminals west of
Billings, they will worsen for terminals to the east. KMLS, KSHR,
and KBHK will have a 40% to see visibility drop below 2 miles, and
a 60% chance for ceilings to drop below 1000ft. Visibility could 
reduce even lower than stated in the TAFs if strong winds coincide
with snowfall this evening and overnight. Rain will be switching 
over to snow sooner than most models depict, and this is reflected
in the TAFs. All precipitation should be out of the area by late 
Monday morning. Vertz
