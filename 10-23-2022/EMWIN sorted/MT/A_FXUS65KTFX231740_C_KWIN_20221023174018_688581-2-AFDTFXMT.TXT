...AVIATION SECTION UPDATED...

.SYNOPSIS...

The Fall storm continues to bring winter-like conditions to 
North-central and Southwest Montana through the weekend. In 
addition to snowfall, strong winds are expected today, with gusts 
in excess of 50 mph possible in some locations. Afternoon 
temperatures the next couple days will remain below seasonal 
averages, and Monday lows will dip into the teens and lower 20s. 
Slightly warmer and drier conditions are expected for next week, 
but passing weather systems will maintain periods of gusty winds 
and mostly mountain snow. 

&&

.UPDATE...

An early fall system continues to bring the first impactful 
snowfall of the season this morning. The H700 low is now moving 
east of the CWA, allowing colder air to filter in during the 
coolest part of the day. Snow impacts have lowered from pass level
into some valleys and plains. Slushy roadways, snow accumulation 
on trees/power lines, and gusty northerly winds continue to be the
primary concerns for the near term at least. The snow will 
continue through the afternoon hours, but impacts will begin to 
fade with the increasing diurnal heating. The current winter 
highlights look good for the morning, but will be further 
evaluated this afternoon in anticipation of diminishing impacts. 
Snow tapers off in a west to east fashion this afternoon through 
the evening hours. There will be some consideration for temporal 
extensions to the the current highlights for eastern areas if 
impactful snow lingers into the evening hours. Blended in the 
latest hi-res guidance for pops/QPF, wind/temps, and lowered snow
ratios this afternoon; otherwise, the previous package is 
handling the current situation well. -RCG

.AVIATION...
1140 AM MDT Sat Oct 22 2022 (23/18Z TAF period)

Snow will begin to diminish in a northwest to southeast fashion 
through this evening, along with IFR/LIFR conditions gradually 
trending toward MVFR and above. Partial clearing is expected 
tonight, but MVFR clouds will persist for much of the night, 
particularly in the eastern portions of North-central/Southwest MT 
and near higher terrain. Lighter winds and abundant surface moisture 
will encourage patchy fog development over locations that happen to 
clear out, but confidence is low for impacts at any particular 
terminal. Drier conditions are expected on Monday as southwesterly 
winds increase ahead of an approaching shortwave disturbance. -RCG 

KWYS TAF will not be issued again until airport operations resume 
next spring.

.PREV DISCUSSION...
/ISSUED 225 AM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022/

Today through tonight...Snowfall has made way to the plains across 
North-central and Southwest Montana early Saturday evening as a 
strong fall storm continues to bring winter-like conditions 
throughout the remainder of the weekend. Surface temperatures will 
dampen the accumulation across warm, road surfaces; however, the 
cold, northern air on the backside of the low will aid in the 
development of wet, slushy roads, especially along the central and 
northern zones across the CWA. 

Latest model runs suggest snow accumulation values have decreased 
quite a bit along the Hi-Line, but more significantly for the 
eastern portions. Values have remained generally the same from the 
previous model run elsewhere. Snow rates thus far at the Great Falls 
office have been 0.2 in/hr. Across the CWA, snow rates are looking 
more like 0.25 to 0.50 in/hr with heavier localized.

NBM v4.1 depicts a medium (60-70%) chance of the aforementioned 
wind gusts to reach 45 mph, while areas within more wind-prone 
locations (Judith Basin and Fergus counties) have a medium (60-70%) 
chance of seeing 50 mph wind gusts. The Canyon Ferry area remains 
within a high (>80%) chance of experiencing wind gusts in excess of 
50 mph. These winds, in conjunction with the heavy, wet snow, has 
posed an additional risk for tree damage and falling on power lines 
which may result in power outages. 

As the low propagates eastward, so does the snow, diminishing west 
to east late Sunday afternoon, lingering across areas in the far 
eastern portion of the CWA. Timing extensions to the current 
highlights may become required to account for this, but confidence 
was too low to make this call at this time. Otherwise, all current 
highlights remain unchanged and remain in effect through 0z Monday.

Afternoon temperatures tonight remain a few degrees above or below 
the freezing mark for most locations. It's not until Sunday night 
when the temperatures plunge into the teens; however, cloud coverage 
may aid in keeping warmer temperatures in some locations. Needless 
to say, this will be the resultant of the end of the growing season 
for the year.  

Monday through next Sunday...The deep trough begins to exit the 
region late midday Monday, resulting in a more zonal flow aloft. 
Winds shift from the northwest to a westerly flow, leading to 
additional gusty winds in wind-prone locations again. NBM v4.1 
suggests a high (70-80%) chance of gusts exceeding 55 mph across the 
Rocky Mountain Front, with a medium (50%) chance of these winds 
extending into the Cut Bank area. Fortunately the snowfall from the 
previous system should be wet and heavy enough to not lead to any 
blowing snow concerns.

Additionally, a positively-tilted trough propagates into the region 
from the Gulf of Alaska midday Wednesday, bringing with it a medium 
(50-60%) chance of snow across the Rocky Mountain Front and in the 
mountains of Southwest Montana, particularly between I-191 and I-
287, Wednesday night into Thursday morning, albeit minimal 
accumulation is expected. Thereafter, the remainder of the outlook 
period will consist primarily of weak ridging and zonal flow, 
indicative of drier conditions and the potential for some 
stronger winds. Afternoon temperatures increase to above freezing,
but remain generally pretty cool, with most locations in the 
lower to mid 40s for the remainder of the work week. The weekend; 
however, looks to be a bit warmer with temperatures within 
seasonal averages for most locations. - Pierce
