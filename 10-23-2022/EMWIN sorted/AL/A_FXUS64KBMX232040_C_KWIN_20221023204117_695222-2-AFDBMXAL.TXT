(This evening through Monday)
Issued at 1250 PM CDT SUN OCT 23 2022

High pressure over the southeast US will remain today and slowly
move east through the day on Monday. Dry weather is expected
through the short term. Low level flow will remain from the south
and southwest...with moisture and warm air advection expected to
remain. Winds will increase slightly on Monday with a weak mid
level jet moving towards the state. Otherwise...light winds and
variable cloudiness will be the main weather features today and
tomorrow. High temperatures today will be in the mid to upper 70s.
Low temperatures tonight will be in the mid 40s to lower 50s. High
temperatures on Monday will be in the upper 70s and lower 80s.

Models continue to indicate a high shear/low cape setup for the
Tuesday severe event. Adjusted timing slightly, showing a quicker
approach and exit of the rain/storms. Not much has changed
dynamically, with the rotating shortwave over Arkansas, and a
trailing cold front through the Deep South. Finer details will 
come down to whether a quality boundary layer characterized by 
dewpoints in the mid to upper 60s advects northward in time to
overlap quality forcing and wind shear. Will maintain a mention of
marginal storms for now.

Within a complex trough over the western CONUS and Plains a potent
low amplitude shortwave trough will eventually consolidate over
the Southern Plains Monday night. This shortwave will take on a
negative tilt as it quickly lifts northeastward across the Mid-
South Tuesday afternoon and evening, resulting in strong height
falls and forcing for ascent across the northern half of Alabama.
It will also be accompanied by a 100kt upper-level jet streak and
75 to 80 kt mid-level jet streak on its southeastern flank and 
associated upper-level divergence, as well as a 50 to 55 kt LLJ. 
In response a deepening surface low will lift northeastward across
the Ozarks with a trailing cold front/pressure trough, keeping 
winds backed across Central Alabama. This will be a typical fall 
high shear low CAPE system, with a narrow axis of mid to perhaps 
upper 60s dew points and associated CAPE values mainly at or below
500 J/kg, though CAPE could approach 1000 J/kg near the MS state 
line at peak heating. Shear will be plentiful with 0-6km bulk 
shear values around 60 to 65 kts and 0-1 km SRH will be around 200
to 300 m2/s2. Strong forcing will favor upscale growth to a 
squall line especially the further north you go, though with a 
decent perpendicular component of shear vectors to the line some 
line breaks and embedded supercells are expected as well. Activity
may stay cellular the longest the further south you go with 
weaker forcing and somewhat drier air aloft. 

Environment will be favorable for a couple tornadoes mainly in 
our far western counties, with a lower but non-zero threat for a 
brief tornado further east. Localized damaging winds will also be 
possible given the strong wind fields. These narrow instability 
axis events are always tricky as everything has to line up just 
"right", and convection can sometimes out-run the instability or 
preceding showers can limit the instability. Uncertainty regarding
instability increases for the eastern counties and dynamics will 
also begin to quickly lift out during the evening hours. Will 
start off with a broad marginal/level 1 out of 5 risk for now, but
in reality this will be a continuum between a relatively greater 
threat further west (where an upgrade to a slight/level 2 out of 5
risk could occur pending later high res model data) and a 
relatively lower threat further east. Meanwhile, some gusty 
gradient winds approaching 35 mph may occur given 925mb winds 
around 40 to 45 kts. With fast storm motions and dry antecedent 
conditions, do not see any flooding concerns at this time. 

Precip quickly exits late Tuesday night. Dry and somewhat cooler
conditions are expected for Wednesday and Thursday behind the
front though nowhere near as cold as last week. Another southern
stream trough arrives Friday, but there continues to be a lot of
ensemble spread regarding the speed and moisture availability with
the system depending on how cut off it becomes from the northern
stream flow.

High pressure and dry weather is expected through the TAF period.
Moisture will increase with clouds increasing through the
afternoon today and again Monday late morning...though VFR
conditions are expected.

.FIRE WEATHER...

High pressure and dry weather will remain through Monday, with
increasing moisture ahead of the next storms system. RH values 
will increase to 35 to 55 percent Monday afternoon. 20 foot winds
will be from the southeast through Monday at 8-12 mph. Moisture 
and winds increase further on Tuesday, with showers and a few 
thunderstorms Tuesday afternoon and Tuesday night as a cold front 
moves through.

Drier conditions return for Wednesday and Thursday, but with
minimum RH values above critical thresholds.
