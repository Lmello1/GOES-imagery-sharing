.NEAR TERM...
(Now through Monday)
Issued at 1255 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Current satellite imagery indicates that some broken high clouds 
are streaming from northwest to southeast across the area, and 
this will continue through today. Water vapor imagery indicates 
that mid-level moisture is gradually increasing across the area, 
and as such we expect cloud bases to gradually lower across the 
region tonight and Monday as more moisture becomes available. The 
moderating temperature trend will continue today through Monday as
well. 

Mostly dry weather continues through Monday, although some of the 
CAMs do suggest a slight potential for some isolated showers 
developing out over the Gulf tonight into Monday morning as 
increasing southeasterly flow advects more moisture into the area. 
For now we don't think much, if any of this isolated activity will 
occur over land areas, but if it does it would be near the coast and 
most likely to occur late tonight and Monday morning. For now we 
will continue with no PoPs through the near term period. 

Aloft, weak cut off low pressure off the Carolina coast early this 
morning will weaken further along the Mid Atlantic coastal area 
through Monday. To the southwest of the weakening upper low, upper 
level ridging continues over our area through Monday, but beginning 
to weaken during the day on Monday as a storm system starts to 
develop over the Plains States. At the surface, high pressure 
continues across the eastern CONUS, ridging down into our area from 
the northeast. With this, a general east to southeast low level flow 
is maintained through the period as our area remains on the 
southwest periphery of this ridge through Monday. 

This pattern will continue to result in a gradual moderation of 
temperatures across the area, but low level moisture return will be 
slower to occur. Model guidance and ensembles keep PWATs below .9 
inches through this evening, but by late tonight and into Monday 
PWATs may increase to around 1.0-1.2 inches over the Gulf waters 
just offshore of our area, and possibly extend northward into 
portions of extreme southwest AL and interior southeast MS by early 
Monday. As stated earlier, this may aid in the development of a few 
isolated marine showers late tonight into Monday morning, but with 
the lack of any real forcing we don't expect any of this isolated 
activity (if it even occurs at all) to spread inland at this time, 
and as indicated earlier, for now we will maintain the dry and 
rainfree forecast through Monday. 

As for temperature, highs today will mainly be in the upper 70s, but 
a few lower 80s are possible, mainly over interior south central AL. 
Similar high temperatures are expected on Monday, but lower 80s may 
be a little more widespread across the area on Monday. Lows tonight 
will range from the upper 40s over far northern inland zones, to the 
low and mid 50s elsewhere over inland areas. Upper 50s and lower 60s 
are expected closer to and along the coast tonight. /12
