.NEAR TERM...
(Now through Monday)
Issued at 312 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Most areas will remain dry through Monday as return flow 
arrives ahead of the next approaching system. Upper level high 
pressure will build over the central Gulf in response to a deepening 
upper trough over the four corners region. This system will be the 
big weather maker as we head into mid week, but for Monday we will 
just see a steady moistening. At the surface, high pressure will 
shift east into the western Atlantic bringing southerly return flow 
to the area as the gradient tightens throughout the day on Monday. 
The only appreciable chance for rain would be late tonight and into 
the day tomorrow over coastal Alabama and southeastern Mississippi. 
As profiles slowly moisten towards 1 to 1.25 inch PWATS, a few 
isolated showers along a very weak convergence band could be 
possible mainly offshore, but could sneak inland at some point. 
Profiles will likely remain too dry overall for much of anything but 
cannot rule it out and thus an isolated POP has been introduced to 
the forecast. Nothing crazy just around 15%.

With the introduction of increasing southerly flow and richer 
moisture to the area, we will likely see a continued modification of 
temperatures with highs climbing into the low to mid 80s across the 
area. Lows will also slowly increase as dewpoint temperatures 
increase. With increasing southerly flow the rip current risk will 
climb to MODERATE tomorrow. BB/03

.SHORT TERM...
(Monday night through Wednesday night)
Issued at 312 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Moisture return will increase Monday night into Tuesday as a 
strong upper shortwave moves across the southern plains into the 
Ohio Valley by Tuesday night. The shortwave will take on negative
tilt as it moves northeast. An associated sfc cold front will move
east and across the area Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night.
Precipitable water values increase to around 1.6 to 1.7 inches
ahead of the front. The increase in moisture along with forcing 
along the front will bring scattered to numerous showers and 
thunderstorms to portions of the area. The best forcing and upper
dynamics rapidly shift north east as the front moves east.
Therefore, the greatest severe thunderstorms risk is expected to 
remain north and west of the local area. However, an isolated 
strong to severe storm cannot be ruled out (especially across far
northwest portions of the area) and the entire area is in a 
Marginal Risk on Tuesday. The highest rain chances will also be 
across northwest areas Tuesday afternoon and evening. Areas to the
south and east will likely miss out on meaningful rainfall. A 
cooler and drier airmass will move into the area behind the front.
Highs on Tuesday will be in the upper 70s and low 80s with upper 
60s to low/mid 70s on Wednesday. /13

.LONG TERM...
(Thursday through Sunday)
Issued at 312 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

A dry and seasonable airmass continues across the area through
early Friday as high pressure moves north of the region. Rain
chances return Friday afternoon into Saturday as a fast moving 
southern stream upper low moves across the area. The lack of 
significant moisture return ahead of this system is expected to 
limit the risk of heavy rain and strong storms with mainly scattered
showers expected. Highs will start the period in the low to mid 
70s warming into the upper 70s to near 80 late in the week. High
temps will drop back into the upper 60s and low 70s behind the
front. /13

.MARINE...
Issued at 312 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

No significant impacts are expected for the marine area 
through the weekend. Southeasterly flow is expected to increase late 
tonight and into Monday. A moderate to occasionally strong southerly 
flow will develop, along with building seas, ahead of an approaching 
cold front Monday night and Tuesday. Moderate offshore flow is 
expected to develop late Tuesday night into Wednesday as the front 
moves south of the marine area. The offshore flow will then continue 
on Thursday, but will gradually be diminishing along with subsiding 
seas. Hazardous conditions for small craft will be increasing during 
the early and middle part of this week. /12
