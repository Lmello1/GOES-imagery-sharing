This Hazardous Weather Outlook is for portions of western and north 
central Nebraska.

.DAY ONE...This afternoon and tonight.

Unseasonable warmth, strong southwest winds, and dry air has resulted 
in critical fire weather conditions today ahead of an advancing cold 
front. Any fire start will be capable of spreading rapidly and 
becoming very difficult to control. In addition, the wind may produce
areas of blowing dust. Winds switch to the northwest with 
precipitation chances increasing behind the front, which passes 
through the forecast area this evening. Rain may transition to a rain
snow mix late tonight near the Pine Ridge and across far northern 
Nebraska, but accumulation is not expected.

.DAYS TWO THROUGH SEVEN...Monday through Saturday.

Blustery northwest winds are expected Monday in the wake of the cold
front. 

.SPOTTER INFORMATION STATEMENT...

Spotter activation is not expected at this time.
