...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 PM CDT THIS EVENING...

.DISCUSSION...

Strong south winds (gusts 40 to 60 mph) will occur today in 
eastern Nebraska and western Iowa. Minimum afternoon relative 
humidity values will range from 20 to 40 percent, with the lowest 
values in eastern Nebraska. Toss in the very dry fuels and these 
factors will produce very high or extreme fire dangers. In
addition, a few strong to isolated severe thunderstorms will be 
possible late this afternoon into this evening. Any fires that 
ignite will spread rapidly and exhibit extreme fire behavior. A 
Red Flag Warning remains in place for a portion of the region. 

A cold front will move through late this evening and overnight,
with winds subsiding a bit (still some 20 to 25 mph gusts) and 
becoming more westerly to northwesterly. Said lighter winds, 
higher humidity, and possibly some light rainfall in southeast 
Nebraska and southern Iowa should lead to improving conditions 
Monday.
