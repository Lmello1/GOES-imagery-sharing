.DISCUSSION...
Issued at 400 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

At 4 AM, the upper level trough that will be today's weather 
maker was clearly visible on satellite over the Rockies. Way to 
the south Hurricane Roslyn was moving into the coast of Central 
Mexico. Locally skies were clear and surface winds were out of 
southeast, in response to a developing lee trough in the High 
Plains. Strong surface WAA was keeping temperatures unusually warm
for this time of year (upper 50s and 60s).

Today & Tonight:

The next 24 hours continue to look like a very active period, 
with strong winds, record warmth, severe thunderstorms and fire 
weather concerns all on the table. Forecast confidence is high 
regarding the development of strong winds and record warmth. 
Concerning the potential for severe storms or extreme fire dangers
forecaster confidence is moderate.

As the upper level trough moves from the Rockies into the Plains
today, a surface low will develop in western Nebraska and drift
east into the Dakotas. Tight surface pressure gradients, a well
mixed boundary layer and mid level (850 mb) winds of 40 to 50 
knots will lead to gusty southerly winds in the Central Plains 
today. A secondary jet streak (850 mb wind 55 to 65 kt) should 
lift north out of Kansas this evening and this will bring a peak 
in wind gusts. Our going forecast suggests gusts of 40 to 50 mph 
from noon to 4 PM, then gusts of 45 to 60 mph between 4 PM and 
midnight, followed by gusts of 35 to 45 between midnight and 2 AM.
Though winds may be pushing High Wind Warning criteria this 
evening, we stuck with the Wind Advisory to keep messaging 
consistent with neighboring offices. This will just end up being a
higher end Advisory event.

The strong southerly winds today will produce strong low level
WAA and this will combine with ample sunshine and boundary layer
mixing to produce afternoon high temperatures that are 24 to 30 
degrees above seasonal averages. Our going forecast has afternoon
highs of 89 degrees in Omaha, 90 in Lincoln and 88 in Norfolk. 
All three forecast values would exceed the daily record highs for 
the date. (Daily Records: Omaha: 84 degrees in 1899, 84 degrees in
1915 & Norfolk 87 degrees in 1927)

The outlook for thunderstorms today remains relatively unchanged
compared to this time yesterday. Though dewpoints will only be in
the 50s this afternoon and evening, strong forcing for ascent and
boundary layer heating should be sufficient for scattered 
convection after 5 PM. Sounding wind profiles support the 
potential for supercell activity (0-6 km shear > 60 kt), with 
damaging winds as the primary hazard (inverted V profiles and 850
mb winds of 55 to 65 kt). An isolated large hail report can't be 
ruled out. The peak window for severe activity should be between 
6 PM and midnight.

Not to be forgotten is the fire weather threat for today. A Red
Flag Warning remains in place for the region due to the very dry 
fuels, strong winds and low humidity. Though minimum relative 
humidity values (25 to 30 percent) may not reach typical 
thresholds to trigger extreme fire dangers, the strong winds and 
very dry fuel conditions should pick up the slack. Thus no
adjustments were made to the Red Flag warning. Fire dangers should
peak between noon and 8 PM.

Quality Rain Near Miss Monday & Tuesday:

The core of today's trough should drift into Canada by Monday, 
though it's axis should still extend south through the Dakotas and
into Nebraska. Meanwhile a second trough will pull out of the 
Desert Southwest. As it does, it will ingest and pull northward a
slug of moisture from former Hurricane Roslyn in Central Mexico. 
This northward push of moisture coupled with lift from the 
southern shortwave should produce a band of heavy rain from Texas
to Missouri. Guidance continues to keep the bulk of the rain to 
our east, and thus our forecast keeps rain amounts on the lighter
side Monday. Forecast rain totals range from 0.20 to 0.50 inches 
near Falls City to 0.10 inches or less along Interstate 80
Corridor.

Weather Free Wednesday:

A weak surface high and upper level ridging are expected to drift 
through the Plains on Wednesday. This should bring dry weather, 
modest winds and mild temperatures to eastern Nebraska and western 
Iowa. Expect seasonal temperatures with highs in the upper 50s 
and lower 60s.

Another Trough to Closeout the Workweek:

The next noteworthy upper level trough should track through the 
Rockies Thursday, and then move into the Plains Friday. Guidance 
from the ensembles (GEFS, EPS and CMCE) and deterministic 
GFS/ECMWF are thinking along similar lines, as they all track the
core of the trough through Texas, Oklahoma/ and Kansas on Friday.
A southerly track like this would not be overly favorable for 
precipitation chances or totals in Iowa and Nebraska. Despite 
this, ensemble mean QPF fields continue to generate 0.01 to 0.10 
inches of precipitation in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa 
between Thursday evening and Friday evening. Thus we have keep a 
slight chance of rainfall in the forecast for this period. There 
don't appear to be any significant frontal boundaries with the 
trough, and so temperatures should remain fairly stagnant Thursday
and Friday. Our forecast continues to favor upper 50s or lower 
60s both days.

Thoughts on the Upcoming Weekend:

Friday's shortwave trough in the Plains may shift towards the 
Tennessee and Ohio River Valleys by Saturday. Run to run trends in 
the EPS and GEFS guidance continue to move the system towards the
southeast, while the CMCE is maintaining a slightly more 
northerly track. Either of these solutions would leave Nebraska 
and Iowa with surface high pressure and dry weather for next 
Saturday. By Sunday there are hits in the ensemble guidance of 
another weak trough that may track east along the Montana/Canada 
border. There is no real reason to think this feature would bring
any precipitation chances for us, so the outlook for Sunday 
remains dry as well. NBM temperature guidance for next Saturday 
and Sunday favors highs in the low or mid 60s.

.AVIATION...(For the 18Z TAFS through 18Z Monday afternoon)
Issued at 1229 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Strong south winds will persist into tonight, with gusts of 40 to
50 kts possible at times. The winds are also leading to some 
blowing dust upstream, so would expect that to eventually make it 
here, with potential for MVFR visibility. Even stronger winds 
aloft (55 to 65 kts) will also lead to some low level wind shear 
this evening and overnight. A few scattered storms may move 
through this evening, but confidence in direct impact to a TAF 
site remains on the lower side. Most probable timing would be 
somewhere in the 00 to 04Z window. Any storms will be capable of 
gusts greater than 50 kts and possibly brief MVFR visibility. 
Behind the storms and a cold front, winds will become westerly to 
northwesterly and subside a bit, but still could gust around 20 
kts at times into early Monday morning. Finally, some guidance 
still hints at some MVFR ceilings ahead of the front, but vast 
majority keeps us VFR.
