.DISCUSSION...

Critical to extreme fire weather conditions will exist across fire
zones except 204 until the approaching cold front moves through.

Ahead of the front, temperatures have soared into the low/mid 80s
and humidity has plummeted with readings ranging from near 10 
percent south of Interstate 80 to around 17 percent up around the
Niobrara valley. Coincident with the warm temperatures and low 
humidity is an axis of very strong southwesterly winds extending 
from around Imperial up through Ainsworth eastward with gusts of 
40 to 50 mph surging up ahead of the front. Frontal passage is
expected for the highway 83 corridor around 4PM, then highway 183
by 8PM, so there will be several more hours of critical to 
extreme fire weather conditions to contend with. 

Winds will then become northwest behind the front with gusts of 
30 to 40 mph continuing through tonight into Monday. Gusts from 
the Pine Ridge down through the sandhills may be more in the 40 to
45 mph range. However, temperatures will be notably cooler on
Monday with highs ranging form the middle 40s across northwest
Nebraska to the middle 50s south of Interstate 80 and minimum
humidity will also be higher with most locations well above 
30 percent. However some locations south of I-80 may see enhanced
to near critical conditions again tomorrow with the gusty
northwest winds if humidity trends down a bit. 

Trends in guidance have been to a drier solution behind the front
so while some scattered showers are possible north of Interstate 
80 and west of highway 83 this evening through early tonight, no
wetting precipitation is expected. A rumble of thunder may also 
accompany any showers as mid/upper level lapse rates are steep, 
but lightning activity with any storms in our area is expected to
be very low. Any significant convection will reside well off to 
our east where deeper moisture and surface instability are 
present. Any lingering precipitation tapers off late tomorrow as
winds diminish with dry conditions expected through Monday night.

Elevated fire weather conditions return Tuesday for far southwest
Nebraska (zones 210, 219) due to low humidity, and Wednesday 
mainly for wind. The next chance of precipitation arrives by 
Wednesday night with another cool front.
