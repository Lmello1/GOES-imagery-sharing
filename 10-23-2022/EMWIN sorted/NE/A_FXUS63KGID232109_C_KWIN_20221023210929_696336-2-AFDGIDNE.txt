.DISCUSSION...(This evening through Sunday)
Issued at 408 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Key Messages:

*Red Flag Warning through this evening
*Severe chances this evening have shifted westward slightly
*Blowing Dust Advisory through this evening
*Highs in the 50s and 60s through the rest of the week
*Next precip chance Wednesday night through Friday morning

This has been a very busy forecast today with most of the attention 
focused on the short term due to multiple hazards in the next 12 
hrs. Near record highs today for Hastings and Grand Island...Grand 
Island appears to have already broken the record of 88 degrees 
today. Winds have really picked up as expected with multiple obs of 
gusts over 50 mph across the CWA. These strong winds and the 
antecedent drought conditions have led to large areas of blowing 
dust and reduced visibility. A Blowing Dust Advisory has been issued 
for portions of the area through 8PM tonight due to reduction in 
visibility at times to less than a mile. Satellite is showing a 
strong signal of blowing dust advecting across the area. 

The dry conditions (along with the presence of a dry line) have led 
to dewpoints down in the 40s and 50s with even some 30s! This is 
leading to RH values mostly less than 25% and coupled with the 
strong winds is leading to critical and near critical fire weather 
conditions across the CWA. A Red Flag Warning is in effect through 
8PM for the entire area. We are already seeing several fires on 
satellite. 

Regarding the severe weather potential this evening... 

Hi-res models have been trending further west with the set up of the 
dry line and placing it around the HWY 281 corridor this afternoon 
and evening. Models are also producing convection slightly earlier 
than expected, but this appears to not be early enough as we are 
already seeing some weak storms popping up on radar. These 
initial storms are not expected to be severe and are fairly weak 
in nature. SPC has pulled the Slight Risk further to the west in 
conjunction with model support. The main risk for severe weather 
looks to be after 5 PM and mainly east of HWY 281. Storms are 
expected to clear the area by around 10-11 PM. The main threat 
would be damaging wind gusts to around 70 mph. Though due to the 
strong shear and helicity present, a tornado cannot be ruled 
out...however there is not much CAPE to work with, less than 1,000
J/kg which is about the minimum we would like to see for 
tornadoes. 

For the remainder of the forecast temperatures will be much cooler 
and more seasonable behind the front with highs in the 50s and 60s. 
Our next potential system is mainly Thursday into Friday. Cluster 
analysis shows a trof over the Rockies with 3 out of the 4 clusters 
showing a deepening of the trof as it moves east. This looks like it 
may then favor the precip being generated in the EC and the Canadian 
rather than the drier GFS for Thursday into Friday. The NBM however 
brings PoPs in as early as Wednesday night and keeps them around 
through Friday morning. This is indicative of model disagreements in 
the pace of this trof and possibly the presence of a leading 
shortwave.

.AVIATION...(For the 18Z KGRI/KEAR TAFS through 18Z Monday)
Issued at 1228 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

VFR conditions expected through the end of the period. Today's
main concern is the strong winds. Winds this afternoon will
continue to be out of the south and southwest at around 20-30 kts
with gusts to around 40 kts possible. Winds will remain elevated
through the evening and will come down slightly to around 15-20
kts with gusts to around 30 kts after midnight. Winds will
continue to decrease after midnight and towards morning. Expect
steady northwesterly winds tomorrow. 

Skies will remain clear to mostly clear through the evening then
cloud cover will slowly begin to increase overnight to broken
around morning tomorrow. These are expected to be mainly mid and
high level clouds.
