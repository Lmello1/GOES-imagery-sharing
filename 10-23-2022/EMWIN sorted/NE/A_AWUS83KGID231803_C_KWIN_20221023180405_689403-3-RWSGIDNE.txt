103 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

A warm and windy day is in store for the region today. High 
temperatures will be in the mid-80s to near 90 today. Southerly 
winds will increase to 25 to 35 mph by early this afternoon with 
wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph. Fire weather will be a major concern 
this afternoon as dry conditions and gusty winds will allow for 
fires to quickly spread. Some area could also see reduced 
visibilities due to blowing dust. In addition...there will be a 
threat for severe thunderstorms with wind gusts possibly up to 
around 70 mph this evening...primarily east of Highway 281. The 
winds will slowly taper off late this evening and a cold front is 
forecast to move through the region early Monday morning which will 
bring cooler temperatures for the work week.
