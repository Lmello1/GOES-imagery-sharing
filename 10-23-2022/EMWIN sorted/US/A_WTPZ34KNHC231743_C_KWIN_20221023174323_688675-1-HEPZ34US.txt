DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Roslyn was 
located near latitude 23.8 North, longitude 104.4 West. Roslyn is 
moving toward the north-northeast near 20 mph (31 km/h).  This 
general motion with some increase in forward speed is expected 
today. On the forecast track, Roslyn will move farther inland over 
west-central Mexico through this evening.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Rapid weakening is expected to continue, and 
Roslyn is forecast to become a tropical depression by this evening 
and dissipate tonight or early Monday. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km).  
An observing site at Marismas Nacionales near Felipe Angeles in the 
state of Nayarit reported sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) and a 
gust to 67 mph (107 km/h) within the past hour or so.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 988 mb (29.18 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue to spread inland 
through portions of west-central Mexico through late afternoon or 
early evening.  Wind speeds atop hills and mountains are often up 
to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds indicated in 
this advisory, and in some elevated locations could be even greater.
 
RAINFALL: Roslyn is expected to produce the following rainfall
totals across coastal areas of west-central Mexico:
 
Upper coast of Jalisco, Nayarit including Islas Marias: 4 to 8
inches with maximum amounts of 10 inches.
 
Southeastern Sinaloa, southern Durango into southwestern Zacatecas:
4 to 6 inches with maximum amounts of 8 inches.
 
This rainfall could lead to flash flooding and landslides in areas
of rugged terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  Water levels along the coast of Mexico within the 
warning area should gradually subside this afternoon.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Roslyn will affect portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico, west-central Mexico, and the southern
portion of the Baja California peninsula through tonight.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
