National Weather Service Marquette MI
359 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

For waters beyond 5 nautical miles of shore on Lake Superior.

Waves are the significant wave height - the average of the
highest 1/3 of the wave spectrum. Occasional wave height is the
average of the highest 1/10 of the wave spectrum.

.SYNOPSIS...A 29.1 inch low continues to track into the Northern 
Plains. Expect the low to continue lifting northeastward towards 
Hudson Bay Monday into Tuesday as it strengthens to 29.0 inches. 
In its wake, a weak 29.8 inch ridge briefly builds over Lake 
Superior, strengthening to at least 30.3 inches by Thursday as a 
high pressure center moves over. As the high pressure heads out 
eastwards Thursday night into Friday, expect it to leave behind a 
30.4 inch ridge over the lake as it strengthens to around 30.5 
inches near the Ontario/Quebec border.
