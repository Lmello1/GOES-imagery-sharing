OPEN LAKE FORECAST for Lake Michigan
National Weather Service Milwaukee/Sullivan WI
236 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

FOR WATERS BEYOND FIVE NAUTICAL MILES OF SHORE ON Lake Michigan.

Waves are provided as a range of significant wave heights, which
is the average of the highest 1/3 of the wave, along with the
average height of the highest 10% of the waves which will
occasionally be encountered.

.SYNOPSIS...

Low pressure of 29.0 inches in western Nebraska will lift
northeastward tonight, reaching northeastern North Dakota by
Monday morning. Persistent breezy south to southeast winds are 
expected ahead of the low through Monday, eventually becoming 
northerly by mid-week behind a cold front. Though there could be a
few gusts to 35 knots through Monday, winds are expected to 
largely remain below gale force given the warmer air over the 
cooler lake. 

Another area of low pressure, averaging 29.5 inches will lift
northeastward from Arkansas to Michigan Tuesday and Wednesday. As
that area of low pressure reaches Michigan on Wednesday, northerly
winds will increase across the lake, possibly getting close to
gale force over the southern half on Wednesday.
