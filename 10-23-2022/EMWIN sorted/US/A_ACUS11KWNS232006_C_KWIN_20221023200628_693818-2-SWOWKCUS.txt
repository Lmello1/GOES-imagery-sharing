Areas affected...east-central Nebraska into north-central Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 232006Z - 232230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated severe cells may develop near a dryline extending
from central Nebraska into Kansas, producing hail and enhanced wind
gusts. Uncertainty is high regarding coverage of storms.

DISCUSSION...A dryline extends south from a deep surface low along
the SD/NE border, with very strong southwesterly winds enhancing
convergence. Heating continues across the region as well, which is
leading to an uncapped air mass near the dryline. Latest visible
imagery also shows growing cumulus fields, with a few deepening
showers. 

The air mass ahead of the dryline remains relatively dry, with
dewpoints mixing into the upper 40s and lower 50s F. However, steep
lapse rates exist aloft, which still results in 500+ J/kg MUCAPE
across the warm sector. 

The combination of low-level convergence, heating, and sufficient
moisture may yield isolated strong to severe storms over the next
few hours. Downdraft-enhanced wind gusts will be possible, within
the broader-scale strong wind environment. Long hodographs with good
storm relative inflow east of the dryline and cold temperatures
aloft will favor hail as well. 

Given a relatively narrow zone of uncapped air, and questions
regarding storm coverage, a watch is not currently anticipated, but
could be needed should storms become more widespread.
