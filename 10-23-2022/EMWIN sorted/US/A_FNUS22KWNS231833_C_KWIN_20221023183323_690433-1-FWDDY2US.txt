...Synopsis...
A deep mid-level trough ejecting east across the Rockies will
support broad ascent over much of the Plains and central US Monday.
An associated cold front will sweep east supporting numerous showers
and thunderstorms across portions of the central and southern
Plains. Behind the deep surface low and cold front, a much cooler
airmass will move into the central US limiting the potential for
fire weather conditions. The only exception will be weak offshore
flow possible across the southern California coastal ranges behind
the upper trough. Here, occasional gusty winds and lower humidity
may support a few hours of locally elevated fire weather concerns.
However, given minimal coverage and spotty dry fuels, critical fire
weather potential remains low.
