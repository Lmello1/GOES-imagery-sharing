SIGNIFICANT WEATHER DISCUSSION ISSUED BY THE PRAIRIE AND ARCTIC STORM
PREDICTION CENTRE OF ENVIRONMENT CANADA AT 2:00 PM CDT SUNDAY OCTOBER
23 2022.

ALERTS IN EFFECT...SNOWFALL WARNING FOR SOUTHERN ALBERTA AND PARTS
OF SOUTHERN SASKATCHEWAN. FREEZING RAIN WARNING FOR SOUTHEASTERN
SASKATCHEWAN. SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT FOR PARTS OF SOUTHERN
SASKATCHEWAN AND MANITOBA.

SYNOPTIC OVERVIEW...ALOFT TODAY, AN UPPER LOW IN THE GULF OF ALASKA
IS SUPPORTING A ZONAL ONSHORE FLOW NEAR BRITISH COLUMBIA, BUT THE
UPPER JET QUICKLY DROPS SOUTHWARDS OVER A CENTRAL PACIFIC HIGH AND
INTO A DEEP UPPER TROUGH OVER THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. AN UPPER LOW SITS
ALONG THE MT/ID/WY TRI-STATE BORDER REGION. THE FLOW EJECTS BACK
NORTHWARDS OVER THE AMERICAN PLAINS, CROSSES THROUGH SOUTHERN
MANITOBA THEN TURNS EASTWARDS OVER NW ONTARIO AND HUDSON BAY, DIPPING
ACROSS NORTHERN QUEBEC BEFORE EXITING THE COUNTRY OUT INTO THE
ATLANTIC THROUGH LABRADOR AND NEWFOUNDLAND. AN UPPER HIGH SITS OVER
THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WITH RIDGING THAT EXTENDS ALL THE WAY WESTWARDS
ACROSS SOUTHERN QUï¿½BEC, ONTARIO, AND FINALLY TAPERING OFF OVER
SOUTHERN MANITOBA. IN THE ARCTIC, THE POLAR VORTEX SITS OVER THE
CANADIAN ARCTIC ARCHIPELAGO WITH A CYCLONIC FLOW OVER MUCH OF THE
CENTRAL ARCTIC. SLACK FLOW WITH A FEW WEAK SHORTWAVES SITS OVER THE
WESTERN ARCTIC AND ALASKA, AND A DECAYING UPPER LOW SITS OVER DAVIS
STRAIT.

AT THE SURFACE, A 984 MB LOW SITS STACKED WITH ITS UPPER SUPPORT OVER
THE GULF OF ALASKA WITH AN OCCLUDED FRONTAL WAVE WELL TO THE SOUTH
AND A TROWAL WRAPPING OVER NORTHWESTERN BRITISH COLUMBIA. WEAK
RIDGING EXTENDS FROM THE EASTERN PACIFIC OCEAN ACROSS THE PACIFIC
NORTHWEST, BRITISH COLUMBIA INTERIOR, AND ONWARDS ACROSS THE PRAIRIES
TO A 1024 MB HIGH CENTRE STRADDLING THE 60TH PARALLEL OVER NORTHERN
MANITOBA. SOUTH OF THAT, A STRENGTHENING COLORADO LOW SITS OVER SOUTH
DAKOTA, DOWN TO A CENTRAL PRESSURE NEAR 986 MB. THIS LOW HAS A WARM
FRONT SLOWLY MOVING NORTHWARDS THAT ARCS NORTHEASTWARDS THROUGH NORTH
DAKOTA AND MINNESOTA, GRAZING ALONG THE MANITOBA BORDER, THEN
CONTINUES ACROSS NW ONTARIO INTO SOUTHERN QUEBEC. THIS SYSTEM'S COLD
FRONT RUNS SOUTHWEST FROM THE LOW BRIEFLY, THEN TURNS SOUTHWARDS. A
BROAD AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE SITS OVER QUEBEC. IN THE ARCTIC, A
FRONTAL BOUNDARY RUNS SOUTHEASTWARDS FROM NORTHERN YUKON TOWARDS
GREAT SLAVE LAKE, THEN WEAKENS UNDER THE RIDGE. ON THE EASTERN SIDE
OF THE RIDGE, THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY RUNS ACROSS NORTHERN HUDSON BAY
AND HUDSON STRAIT BEFORE CURLING NORTHWARDS TO A DECAYING 997 MB LOW
OVER BAFFIN BAY.

DISCUSSION...

AB...THE FIRST SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL OF THE SEASON IN SOUTHERN ALBERTA
WILL COME TO AN END TODAY. STORM TOTALS IN EXCESS OF 20 CM HAVE
BEEN COMMONPLACE. IN THE SOUTHWEST, UP TO AN ADDITIONAL 5 CM WILL
FALL BEFORE THE SNOW TAPERS OFF THIS AFTERNOON. FURTHER EAST, UP
TO AN ADDITIONAL 10 CM OF SNOW IS EXPECTED FOR THE CYPRESS HILLS. IN
CENTRAL AND NORTHERN REGIONS, SOME FOG PATCHES, WHICH DEVELOPED
OVERNIGHT, WILL DISSIPATE THIS AFTERNOON. THERE IS ALSO A CHANCE
OF MIXED PRECIPITATION TODAY IN THE FORM OF SCATTERED RAIN AND SNOW
SHOWERS.

SK/MB...INTERESTING PRECIPITATION TYPING CHALLENGES AHEAD WITH THIS
COLORADO LOW AS WARM ADVECTION HAS ALREADY STALLED ACROSS MUCH OF
SASKATCHEWAN AND WESTERN MANITOBA, LEAVING A POOL OF NEAR-FREEZING OR
SLIGHTLY WARMER AIR WHOSE TRANSFORMATION WILL LARGELY COME FIRST VIA
DIABETIC EFFECTS OF PRECIPITATION FOLLOWED BY INCREASING COLD
ADVECTION. SO GENERAL EXPECTATION ACROSS MUCH OF SASKATCHEWAN IS THAT
SNOW WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND EASTWARDS UNTIL IT REACHES A
STEADY-STATE POINT WHERE WHAT REMAINS OF THE WARM ADVECTION IS ENOUGH
TO KEEP THE SURFACE TEMPERATURES WARM ENOUGH FOR RAIN. GENERALLY
SPEAKING, THIS TRANSITION LINE WILL ORGANIZE LATER TODAY INTO
TONIGHT, AND REMAIN FAIRLY STEADY AS THE BULK OF WARM ADVECTION RUNS
NORTHEASTWARDS FROM NORTH DAKOTA, AND THE TRANSITION ZONE IS
SUPPORTED BY WHAT WARM AIR CAN WRAP IN ON THE CYCLONIC BRANCH OF THE
WCB.

OBVIOUSLY WITH COLORADO LOWS THIS CAN BE A TRICKY FEATURE TO NAIL
DOWN AHEAD OF TIME, BUT WELL GIVE IT OUR BEST SHOT. CURRENT 850MB
THETA-W ADVECTIONS SHOW WAA THROUGH SW MANITOBA AND FAR SOUTHEASTERN
SASKATCHEWAN, TRANSITIONING TO ISOTHERM-PARALLEL FLOW ALONG A LINE
RUNNING ROUGHLY FROM ASSINIBOIA (CWJI) EAST-NORTHEAST TO BERENS RIVER
(CYBV). THIS LINES UP WELL WITH SNOW FALLING ACROSS ALL OF SW
SASKATCHEWAN, THROUGH REGINA, AND INTO YORKTON (CYQV). AND WESTERN
MANITOBA. WHILE MANY OF THESE AREAS STARTED AS RAIN, WITH NO NOTABLE
THERMAL ADVECTIONS, THE DIABETIC COOLING DUE TO THE SNOW HAS BROUGHT
A TRANSITION TO SNOW DOMINANT PRECIPITATION ACROSS THE ENTIRE REGION.
HEADING FORWARD, COLD ADVECTION WILL STRENGTHEN INTO SOUTHWESTERN
SASKATCHEWAN THIS AFTERNOON, BUT WARM ADVECTION PROFILES WILL BE
SUSTAINED ACROSS SW MANITOBA AND INTO SE SASKATCHEWAN, AND THAT WARM
ADVECTION WILL GRADUALLY SPREAD NORTHWARDS ALONG THE SK/MB BORDER.
COLD ADVECTION WILL CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN IN SASKATCHEWAN,
TIGHTENING UP THE THERMAL GRADIENT ALONG THE BORDER REGIONS. THE WARM
AIR ADVECTION WILL BE MORE SUBSTANTIAL INTO NORTHERN MANITOBA, WHERE
THIS SYSTEMS WARM FRONT WILL LIFT INTO EASTERN MANITOBA WITH WAA AT
850 MB EXTENDING AS FAR NORTH AS NORWAY HOUSE (CYNE) TO SHAMATTAWA.

THIS DEVELOPMENT REGIME WILL MEAN THAT ALMOST ALL AREAS IN
SASKATCHEWAN THAT HAVE TRANSITIONED TO SNOW WILL REMAIN AS SNOW
THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THIS SYSTEM. FOR AREAS NEAR THE MB BORDER,
IT LOOKS LIKELY THAT ANY PRECIPITATION TODAY COULD FALL AS SNOW OR
RAIN MORE INTENSE PRECIPITATION WOULD PUSH THE LIKELIHOOD OF SNOW
HIGHER BUT AS THE LOW PRESSURE CENTRE APPROACHES TONIGHT, MAKE
FREEZING RAIN OR RAIN THE MOST LIKELY PRECIPITATION MODE.
ACCUMULATING FREEZING RAIN WILL BE POSSIBLE TONIGHT EXTENDING FROM
THE SK/ND BORDER NORTHWARDS TO YORKTON (CYQV), THEN ARCING ACROSS
CENTRAL MANITOBA INCLUDING AREAS SUCH AS SWAN RIVER (CWEQ) AND NORWAY
HOUSE (CYNE). THIS FREEZING RAIN THREAT WILL IMPACT BOTH THE
TRANS-CANADA HIGHWAY AND YELLOWHEAD HIGHWAY CORRIDORS OVERNIGHT. EAST
OF THE FREEZING RAIN, ANY PRECIPITATION WILL FALL AS RAIN.

HEADING INTO MONDAY, THE BAND OF FREEZING RAIN WILL SHIFT EASTWARDS
AS THE COLD AIR ADVECTION CONTINUES OVER SK, MOVING INTO WESTERN
MANITOBA AND ARCING ACROSS INTO NORTHEASTERN MANITOBA. [NORTH]WEST OF
THIS, THE PRECIPITATION WILL FALL AS SNOW AND AS RAIN TO THE
SOUTHEAST. THE LOW WILL RAPIDLY MOVE NORTHEASTWARDS ALONG ITS FRONTAL
BOUNDARY THROUGH THE DAY ON MONDAY, SUPPORTING A SLIGHT FREEZING RAIN
THREAT OVER NORTHEASTERN MANITOBA THROUGH THE DAY, MAINLY FOR AREAS
INCLUDING ISLAND LAKE (CYIV) NORTHWARDS THROUGH SHAMATTAWA AND INTO
YORK FACTORY. WHILE THE UPPER-LEVEL IS HIGHLY SUPPORTIVE OF FREEZING
RAIN, THERE DOES REMAIN A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER SURFACE TEMPERATURES
WILL FALL BELOW ZERO OR NOT. THERE IS A CHANCE THAT FOR MUCH OF THE
AREA THE SURFACE TEMPERATURES STAY ABOVE FREEZING AND IT FALLS MERELY
AS RAIN.

IN FACT, EVEN IN THE SOUTHERN PRAIRIES, WITH THE ADVECTIONS MAINLY
STEADY-STATE TURNING COLD, THE FREEZING RAIN MAY END UP BEING A MUCH
MORE TRANSIENT FEATURE AS PART OF A RAIN TO SNOW TRANSITION. WILL BE
KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT THIS AFTERNOON TO REFINE
THE FORECASTS AND ANY ALERTS AS NEEDED.

SNOWFALL WARNINGS, FREEZING RAIN WARNINGS, AND WINTER STORM WARNINGS
WILL BE ISSUED/UPDATED WITH THE AFTERNOON ISSUE OF THE FORECASTS AS
NEEDED.

ELSEWHERE, OVER SOUTHERN MANITOBA, A LATE-SEASON CONVECTIVE
ENVIRONMENT WILL DEVELOP TONIGHT AS WARM, MOIST AIR IS LIFTED INTO
THE REGION. UNSEASONABLY HUMID CONDITIONS WILL BE DRAWN NORTHWARDS
THROUGH THE NIGHT WITH SURFACE DEW POINTS RISING AS HIGH AS 10 TO 15
DEGREES C. WITH A DECENT MOISTURE SOURCE AND VERY STRONG ISENTROPIC
LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADVANCING LOW, ELEVATED CONVECTION IS ALMOST
A CERTAINTY TONIGHT. MUCAPE VALUES WILL INCREASE INTO THE 500 TO 1000
J/KG RANGE OVERNIGHT, WHICH WHEN COMBINED WITH THE STRONG LIFT OVER
THE AREA WILL SUPPORT WAVES OF CONVECTIVE SHOWERS OVER THE REGION.
THE RAIN WILL BEGIN TO BLOSSOM NEAR THE INTERNATIONAL BORDER NEAR
MIDNIGHT, PUSHING NORTHWARDS QUICKLY THROUGH THE NIGHT. MULTIPLE
WAVES OF CONVECTION ARE LIKELY, LASTING INTO MONDAY MORNING BEFORE
TAPERING OFF LIGHTER SCATTERED SHOWER ACTIVITY FOR THE AFTERNOON.
RAINFALL TOTALS FROM THIS WILL BE HIGHLY VARIABLE, BUT WILL RANGE
FROM JUST A TRACE TO AS MUCH AS 25 TO 50 MM IN LOCALIZED AREAS.

NU...THE DECAYING LOW OVER BAFFIN BAY WILL CONTINUE TO SHIFT
NORTHWARDS AND BRING LIGHT SNOW TO THE NORTHERN REACHES OF BAFFIN
ISLAND ON MONDAY. UP TO 5 CM IS EXPECTED.

NWT...NO SIGNIFICANT WEATHER TODAY.
