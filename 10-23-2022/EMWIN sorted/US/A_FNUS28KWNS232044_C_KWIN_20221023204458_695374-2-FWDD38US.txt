Valid 251200Z - 311200Z

Potential for critical fire weather will generally remain low during
the period. Broad areas of the U.S. will have received precipitation
along with cooler temperatures as the strong upper-level trough in
the Plains becomes more compact as it moves into the Northeast
through midweek. Another upper-level trough is forecast to dig
through the West and into the southern Plains by late in the week.
Though locally dry and windy conditions will be possible as the
second trough progresses east, fuel dryness is likely to remain
moderated in most locations. The upper-level pattern becomes more
uncertain towards next weekend as models struggle with the evolution
of the second trough. Surface high pressure will build into the
Great Basin on Thursday. This will promote a return to offshore
winds in southern California. Pressure gradients continue to look
modest and upper-level winds are expected to be weaker than on
Sunday/Monday.
