Tropical Weather Outlook
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
200 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:

Central Subtropical Atlantic:
A trough of low pressure located well to the east of Bermuda 
continues to produce disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity. 
Environmental conditions are not expected to be particularly 
conducive, and any subtropical or tropical development of the system 
should be slow to occur while it moves generally west-northwestward 
at 15 to 20 mph across the subtropical Atlantic. By the middle part 
of this week, further development appears unlikely as the system 
turns northward over the cooler waters of the northwestern Atlantic 
and encounters stronger upper-level winds.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.
