Fire Weather Planning Forecast for Iowa
National Weather Service Des Moines IA
256 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

.DISCUSSION...

Fire weather conditions remain elevated this afternoon into the
early evening. Relative humidity will remain near or above 35%
over the region, with the drier conditions still expected west of
US71. Warm temperatures, strong south winds and mostly cured
grasslands and croplands would allow for fast fire spread. Burning
is highly discouraged over the region and those with harvest plans 
should continue to take measures to mitigate possible fire ignition
points on their machinery.

Isolated to scattered showers and storms will be possible this
afternoon and tonight over most of the region with wetting 
rainfall expected south and east for Monday. Rainfall amounts
Monday may approach a third to 1.25 inches in the far southeast by 
Tuesday morning.
