...Windy Conditions Continue into this Evening...

Strong south to southeast winds can be expected through this

predominately be from the south. Sustained speeds will reach 20 
to 25 mph with some gusts from 35 to 45 mph later today and into
tonight.

Winds of these speeds may blow around loose and unsecured
objects, make travel difficult for high profile vehicles on east 
to west roads, and also lead to an elevated fire danger.
