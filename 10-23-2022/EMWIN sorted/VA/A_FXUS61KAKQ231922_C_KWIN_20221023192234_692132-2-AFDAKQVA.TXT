AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
National Weather Service Wakefield VA
322 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

.SYNOPSIS...
Coastal low pressure slowly lifts north off the Carolina and mid
Atlantic coast through tonight, bringing rain to coastal areas.
Low clouds and a chance for rain may linger into Monday 
afternoon along the coast. Mainly dry and warmer conditions are 
expected Tuesday through Thursday.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH MONDAY/...
As of 240 PM EDT Sunday...

The latest sfc analysis indicates ~1012mb sfc low pressure 
system centered off the coast from NC to southeast VA, with 
~1030mb sfc high pressure centered along the coast of Maine. The
low off the coast is slowly lifting to the N with the upper low
lagging a bit to the W/SW (across the ern NC coastal Plain).
Strong SSE flow offshore has allowed moisture to increase right
at the immediate coast, SPC mesoanalysis indicating PWATs of 
1.60 to 1.70" at the NC coast, rapidly diminishing to ~1.00" 
along the I-95 corridor. 

Measurable QPF has shown a sharp gradient near the coast with
0.25" to 0.50" on avg observed from ECG to VA Beach rapidly
dropping to <0.10" at ORF. As the sfc low continues N late this
evening, expect the precip coverage to become highest across 
the eastern shore, though rain will still be likely across far 
SE VA/NE NC through late aftn. Additional QPF will be light W of
Ches Bay, with locally another 0.25-0.50" across the eastern 
shore. Given the low clouds making it all the way to the I-95 
corridor and low level CAD, highs this aftn will mainly be in 
the lower 60s, though a few places may struggle to reach 60F and
the far west will top out at 65-70F. 

The trends are significantly wetter for tonight and even on
Monday as the GFS/NAM both depict the sfc low becoming centered
just offshore of the NC/VA coast this evening, lingering along 
the eastern shore into Monday. The GFS is actually now the 
slower model (NAM lifts the sfc feature out by midday Monday 
while the GFS stacks it with height, keeping the sfc low over 
the eastern shore into Mon night). Either way, have made some
changes, adding slight chc for tstms this evening over the
eastern shore where there may even be some modest instability
and better mid level lapse rates moving in from the coast for a
few hrs. Have increased clouds tonight through midday Monday 
all areas, with at least chances for rain along the eastern 
shore through early Mon aftn. Lows tonight upper 40s/lower 50s
along and W of I-95, with mid to upper 50s at the coast. 

Mainly cloudy E and cloudy but becoming partly sunny west on 
Monday. Highs in the low 70s W and mid-upper 60s E due to the 
thicker cloud cover.

.SHORT TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
As of 320 AM EDT Sunday...


Tue-Wed looks to be dry and following a warming trend. A front 
will pass through the area Wednesday as low pressure passes SE 
of the Great Lakes on its way to eastern Canada, but precip 
looks to stay west and north of the local area. Highs in the mid
70s Tuesday, then upper 70s on Wednesday. Lows in the upper 
40s-low 50s Monday and Tuesday, low-mid 50s Wednesday.

&&

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...
As of 320 AM EDT Sunday...

A little cooler behind the front and dry Thu into Fri, then as 
strong high pressure builds into northern New England and Atlantic 
Canada next weekend, the onshore flow increases and will have a 25-
35% PoP and mostly cloudy skies Sat. Highs in the lower 70s Thu, 
upper 60s-low 70s Friday and in the 60s Sat (low 70s in NC). Lows in 
the 50s Thursday morning, mid 40s to low 50s Friday, and in the 50s 
Sat.

.AVIATION /20Z SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
As of 200 PM EDT Sunday...

Strong high pressure (~1030mb) centered along the coast of Maine
with ~012mb sfc low pressure off the VA/Carolina coast is
bringing low clouds and IFR/LIFR flight restrictions to the
coast and MVFR-IFR CIGs as far west as the I-95 corridor. N
winds are ~15kt gusting to ~25kt at the coast and ~10kt well
inland. RA/DZ has also mixed in at the coast and a few brief heavier
showers are now pushing through far SE VA and NE NC. Most of the rain
diminishes this evening, but flight restrictions are expected to
prevail for much if not all of the 18Z/23 TAF period, with the 
most consistent IFR- LIFR at the coast and ern shore (especially
ORF and SBY). At RIC, MVFR is expected to be predominant into 
this evening but IFR becomes more likely overnight/early Mon. 
Slowly improving conditions on Monday, but it may not be until
the aftn when the lower clouds scour out. 

Generally dry Mon night through Thu but there may be some 
lingering low clouds through Tue morning near the coast.

.MARINE...
As of 320 PM EDT Sunday...

High pressure is centered between Nova Scotia and coastal New 
England this afternoon while two areas of low pressure are centered 
off the coast (one off of the Outer Banks and another of of the SC 
coast). The pressure gradient along the Mid-Atlantic coast remains 
tight, allowing for N winds 15-25 kt with gusts 25-30 kt over the 
Ches Bay, coastal waters, and Currituck Sound. The Lower James is 
more marginal at 15-20 kt with gusts to 25 kt while the rest of the 
rivers are mainly 10-15 kt with occasional gusts to 20 kt.

Winds will gradually increase a few knots late this afternoon into 
this evening as the coastal low continues to deepen as it tracks 
northward. SCAs are in effect until 6 AM Mon for the Currituck 
Sound, 10 AM Mon for the Ches Bay, 1 AM Mon for the Lower James, and 
4 PM Mon for the coastal waters (due to seas remaining elevated). 
High pressure moves back in behind the low Mon into the middle of 
the week with sub- SCA conditions expected on Tue/Wed. A cold front 
moves through Wed night with winds becoming N 15-20 kt. Winds 
gradually become NNE/NE and increase to 15-25 kt (possibly higher) 
Fri-Sun with another round of SCAs for winds and waves/seas possible 
as the pressure gradient tightens between high pressure over far SE 
Canada/ New England and a coastal low near Bermuda.

Waves and seas are 3-5 ft (4-6 ft for the mouth of the bay) and 6-9 
ft respectively this afternoon. Waves and seas subside to 2-3 ft and 
4-5 ft respectively by early Mon afternoon, subsiding to 1-2 ft and 
3-4 ft by Mon evening as high pressure builds back in and winds 
diminish.
