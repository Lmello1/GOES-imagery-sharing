.UPDATE...
Issued at 947 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Added more small craft advisories through late Monday. Winds and 
waves will fluctuate above and below small craft criteria through 
late Monday, so simplified the hazard to cover the threat periods.

.DISCUSSION...(Today through Saturday)
Issued at 359 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Summary: Warmest day of the week expected today with highs in the 
60s and 70s. Strong southerly winds will be moving in today with 
increasing clouds. Thunderstorms will be possible tonight some of 
which may be severe. Primary hazards are hail and damaging winds. 
The strong winds will continue into Monday with a wind advisory 
possibly being needed. Seasonable temperatures return Tuesday. 

An upper level trough has made it's way into the Mojave desert with 
an upper and lower branch of the jet stream converging over the 
Central Rockies. The cross barrier flow has led to a surface low 
developing on the leeside. Thus far, this is playing out as 
advertised for the past week. Throughout the day we can expect a 
strong surge of southerly winds to bring anomalously warm 
temperatures to the region. Because of this strong push in the 
lower levels we will have a strong cap in place throughout the day
preventing thunderstorm development. As we head into the evening 
hours the low level jet ramps up expeditiously. This combined with
the left exit region of the upper level jet nudging in from the 
southwest will likely set off some storms. SPC has increased the 
marginal risk area for severe storms to now include the western 
half of our CWA. This lines up well with the corridor of stronger 
MUCAPES among the deterministic models. There will be plenty of 
bulk shear for storms to work with speeds upwards of 50 kts. 
Given the elevated nature of the storms hail will likely be the 
primary threat, especially with some steep mid level lapse rates 
of 7-8 C/km overnight. Damaging winds can't fully be ruled out as 
well. Since the systems deepening low may strengthen into the 
985mb range the pressure gradient will certainly be tight. 

Strong winds is another aspect of this incoming system that we are 
closely monitoring. Some of the latest probabilistic guidance is 
bringing wind gusts in excess of 45 mph into Iron County Sunday 
night. This does seem plausible given the deepening low crossing 
into the Northern Plains. The other area and timeframe for concern 
will be across northern MN Monday afternoon as the surface low 
migrates northeast. For now, we will hold off on a wind advisory and 
gather another round of high resolution model data before making a 
decision. 

Monday will continue to support rain showers as a cold front
sweeps across the region. Afterwards, surface ridging builds in 
over the area for some quiet weather. Temperatures will regulate 
back down into the seasonal norms with highs in the 40s and 50s 
during the day and lows teetering around freezing temps. The next 
chance for precipitation arrives Thursday as a shortwave moves in 
from the west.

.AVIATION...(For the 18Z TAFS through 18Z Monday afternoon)
Issued at 1236 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

VFR this afternoon, but increasing chances for IFR overnight as a
large and deep area of low pressure crosses north through 
Minnesota. This will bring strong winds with prevalent LLWS along
with thunderstorms through most of the TAF period. Conditions
should begin to improve Tuesday morning. Surface winds will be
gusty and switch from easterly to southwesterly through the
period.

.MARINE...
Issued at 359 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

East to northeasterly winds will stream across the Lake today and 
increase in the afternoon once again. This has led to another Small 
Craft Advisory being hoisted for portions of the North Shore and 
into the Twin Ports. Another Advisory will likely be needed later 
this evening as strong southerly winds encroach on the South Shore. 
By Monday afternoon all zones will likely be under a Small Craft 
Advisory and carry into Tuesday. A few gales may be possible as 
well, especially along the South Shore where strong winds from the 
land may mix into the waters just offshore. Additionally, 
thunderstorms will be possible Sunday night with rain showers 
continuing through Monday.
