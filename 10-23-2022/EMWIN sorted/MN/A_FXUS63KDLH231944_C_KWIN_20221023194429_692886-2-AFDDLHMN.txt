.DISCUSSION...(This evening through Saturday)
Issued at 243 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Summary: A deep and expansive low pressure will lift north 
through Minnesota bringing strong winds and some thunderstorms.

Warm weather will last another 36 hours or so before a cold front
passes, but before that occurs there’s plenty of weather to 
happen. A large and expansive area of low pressure will lift north
from the Central Plains and pass through the Red River Valley 
before exiting into Canada Monday. A deep upper low taps into the 
subtropical jet and advects a lot of tropical moisture northward. 
The dynamics are quite impressive and thus this strongly forced 
system will be moving a lot of mass through the atmosphere. This 
will equate to strong low level winds with 850mb winds in excess 
of 50 kts over the Northland. Deep mixing will allow efficient 
momentum transfer of some of those stronger winds to the surface 
giving widespread gusts of around 40 mph and localized stronger 
winds overnight into Monday. Convection is expected to spawn off 
of the limited instability (MUCAPE mainly < 1000 J/kg), but strong
forcing in the presence of high 0-3 bulk shear (>65 kts) should 
be enough of a parameter space to allow a few strong storms to 
develop with the main threats being large hail and damaging winds 
overnight into Monday morning – mainly west of Duluth. 

While this system has plenty of moisture wrapped up in it, most 
of the Northland will see fairly light rainfall as a dry slot 
makes its way around the system punching through the core of our 
forecast area. The exceptions may be along the North Shore where 
orographic enhancement will help squeeze some extra rainfall out 
of the warm conveyor belt portion of the system.

Eventually, the cold front with this mature system will cross 
Tuesday morning marking a transition to much cooler air and stable
weather for the rest of the week.

.AVIATION...(For the 18Z TAFS through 18Z Monday afternoon)
Issued at 1236 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

VFR this afternoon, but increasing chances for IFR overnight as a
large and deep area of low pressure crosses north through 
Minnesota. This will bring strong winds with prevalent LLWS along
with thunderstorms through most of the TAF period. Conditions
should begin to improve Tuesday morning. Surface winds will be
gusty and switch from easterly to southwesterly through the
period.

.MARINE...
Issued at 243 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

A large area of low pressure will cross north through Minnesota 
bringing strong southerly winds. Due to the warmth in this air 
mass it should mostly float above the waters of the cooler Lake 
Superior except along the waters adjacent to the shoreline. 
Despite this effect, the shear magnitude of this system with much 
much stronger winds aloft will be something to watch. It’s hard to
know how long the buffering effect of warm air over cool water 
will last in such a strongly forced system. So, gales may occur, 
but at the moment don’t seem likely. Furthermore, thunderstorm 
activity will be present near Lake Superior and these could also 
help drive some of the stronger winds (50+ kt aloft) to the 
surface. Weather and winds quiet down Tuesday onward.
