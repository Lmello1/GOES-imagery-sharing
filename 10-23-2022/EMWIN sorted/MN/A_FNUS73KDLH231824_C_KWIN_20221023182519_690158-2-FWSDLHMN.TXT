.DISCUSSION...

East winds of 8 MPH observed by the Cass Lake RAWS at 1300 CDT 
are expected to shift to the southeast and increase over the next 
one to two hours. Southeast winds around 15 MPH with gusts to 
around 26 MPH are forecasted through the remainder of the 
afternoon and into tonight. These winds are expected to gradually veer
to the southwest throughout Monday morning. As a cold front 
approaches Cass County on Monday, southwest winds are likely to 
further increase on Monday, reaching gusts as high as 35 MPH by 
the afternoon. Following the cold front passage on Monday 
evening, a wind shift to the west-northwest will occur Monday 
night into Tuesday morning. West-northwest winds on Tuesday are
likely to be lower, with speeds around 10 MPH and gusts to around
15 MPH. 

In addition to the gusty winds, another fire weather concern will
be the potential for thunderstorm development this evening into 
tonight. These scattered storms are currently expected to arrive 
to the fire site around 2100-2200 CDT and continue off and on 
into early Monday morning. Expect gusty and erratic winds to occur
around any thunderstorms. A storm or two may also become strong 
to severe tonight, capable of producing damaging wind gusts to 60 
MPH, large hail up to 1 inch in diameter, and frequent cloud-to-
ground lightning.
