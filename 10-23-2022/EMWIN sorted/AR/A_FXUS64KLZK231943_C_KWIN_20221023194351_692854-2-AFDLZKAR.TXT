.SHORT TERM...
(This evening through Tuesday)
Issued at 243 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Breezy south winds were noted this afternoon, with well above
average temperatures. There were more clouds, which was an 
indication of changes to come.

A large trough of low pressure was making its way through the 
Rockies toward the Plains this afternoon. As the trough heads
to the east, a closed low is expected to form in New Mexico and 
swing into west Texas tonight/Monday.

At the surface, a cold front will be draped from the upper Midwest
to the Texas panhandle Monday morning. Given the closed low in the 
southern Rockies, a strong storm system will form along the front
and will track across north Texas through the afternoon. Ahead of
the system, some severe weather is possible mainly to the 
southwest of Arkansas.

There is an outside chance of isolated severe storms southwest of
Little Rock Monday evening, but the timing is off given 
decreasing instability after dark. Also, the aforementioned front
will sweep through the region Monday night/Tuesday morning. 
Widespread showers/embedded thunderstorms will further limit 
instability. Winds will shift to the northwest and will remain 
strong behind the front.

As far as rainfall, one to more than two inch totals are in the
forecast across the northern/western counties, with half inch to
inch amounts farther to the southeast.

On Tuesday, the storm system/front will exit to the east, with 
additional severe weather possible east of Mississppi River 
as warming occurs. In Arkansas, rain will gradually come to a 
close. Clouds will decrease, and cooler/drier air will overspread
the state.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday Night through next Sunday)
Issued at 243 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

No significant changes will be made to the extended forecast this 
afternoon as models have been trending better with the ejection of a 
strong upper wave and another southern stream low coming in late 
next week. As such, a blend of forecast solutions will be used once 
again.

Period initiates with a continuation of the highly amplified and 
progressive pattern that has been in place of late. The upper low 
responsible for the unsettled conditions in the short term will be 
located over the Missouri bootheel with the associated cold front 
straddling the Mississippi River. Precipitation will be ending 
with gusty west to southwest winds ushering in cooler and drier air. 

Upper low will be replaced by broad ridging over the region and 
surface high pressure passing to the north. This will provide 
several days of dry weather to the forecast area. Meanwhile, another 
upper wave will be digging into the Rockies and emerge into the 
southern Plains by early Friday. System will get cut off from the 
prevailing flow and move across southern Arkansas/northern Louisiana 
as the period concludes. Moisture is much more limited versus the 
system in the short term but will hold on to at least scattered POPS 
Friday and Saturday.

Concerning temperatures, data continues to show near average 
readings through the period or maybe a touch below. Highs will 
average in the 60s/70s and lows in the 40s/50s.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 243 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Breezy south winds are expected thru Monday with gusts of 25 to 
35 mph common. These winds, combined with critically dry fuels, 
will lead to increased fire danger. Humidity will remain elevated 
to mitigate fire weather concerns to a point, but the finer fuels 
such as grasses and brush are more than dry enough to carry 
surface fire with the expected winds. Most Arkansas counties 
remain under a burn ban and any burning is strongly discouraged 
into early next week.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS) 
Issued at 1241 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Low clouds will become more scattered this afternoon, with VFR 
conditions expected. Low clouds should return late tonight/Monday 
morning, with the potential of MVFR conditions in places. Isolated 
showers are expected to develop in western Arkansas Monday morning. 
Breezy south winds will be noted through the period, although winds 
will decrease somewhat tonight and will be less gusty.
