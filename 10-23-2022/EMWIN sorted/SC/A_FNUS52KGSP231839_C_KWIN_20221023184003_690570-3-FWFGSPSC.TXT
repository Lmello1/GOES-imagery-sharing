.DISCUSSION...
Warm and dry conditions are expected to continue into the first half 
of the week before a weak frontal system brings a small chance of 
rain by mid-week. Warm and dry conditions return behind the front 
through the end of the work week.  Expect rain chances to possibly 
increase again next weekend as low pressure approaches from the Gulf 
states.
