Discussion:

 Early this morning a upper level trough is digging through the 
central Rockies. In response to this feature lee cyclogenesis is 
ongoing with a deepening surface low over northeast CO. This is 
acting to tighten the pressure gradient across the area and will 
only further do so today as surface low and its attendant cold front 
move east into the central Plains. This will yield southerly winds 
in the 20 to 30 mph range with gusts to 40 to 50 mph. This WAA will 
again allow temperatures to rise into the low to mid 80s. The well 
above normal temperatures, combined with the strong winds and dry 
fuels and grasses will lead to an elevated fire danger despite 
relative humidity values in the 40 to 50 percent range. Tonight, the 
upper level trough will extend from the northern Plains into the 
Four Corners region. A closed low over western SD ill lift northeast 
and weaken late Sunday night into Monday morning sagging a cold 
front into the area. A few strong thunderstorms may develop out 
ahead of the cold front as it sags into the area tonight. However, 
instability looks very weak and moisture may be lacking so despite 
very strong shear severe potential looks low. By Monday morning a 
upper level low will develop in the base of the trough over the Four 
Corners region. During the day Monday this upper low will move into 
the southern High Plains. A lead shortwave ejecting out from the low 
will cause widespread showers and a few embedded thunderstorms to 
develop along the front. A few lead shortwave ahead of this system 
will provide the chance for a few round of showers through Monday 
night. On Tuesday the upper level low over the Red River Valley will 
shift northeastward across eastern Oklahoma and southern Missouri. 
This will continue rain chances across the southern and eastern CWA 
on Tuesday. this upper low finally pushes east into the lower Ohio 
River Valley Tuesday night bringing rain to an end. All told, 1 to 2 
inches of rain will be possible south and east of I-35 with lesser 
amounts to the north and west. While this is not expected to improve 
drought conditions, it will help keep them from getting worse in the 
short term. highs behind the front on tuesday will be much cooler 
in the mid to upper 50s.

High pressure will build into the area on Wednesday will near normal 
highs in the lower 60s. On Thursday, another upper level trough will 
dig from the central Rockies into the western Plains. This trough 
will then move through the local area Thursday night into Friday. 
There may be light precipitation will this feature as it moves 
through the region however, moisture looks to be lacking. High 
pressure then looks to move back into the area on Saturday keep 
condition dry. Temperatures look to remain seasonable in the 
Thursday through Saturday timeframe with highs ranging between the 
mid 50s to lower 60s.
