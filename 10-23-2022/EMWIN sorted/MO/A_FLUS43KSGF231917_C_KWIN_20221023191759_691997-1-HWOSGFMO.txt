This Hazardous Weather Outlook is for portions of the Missouri
Ozarks and extreme southeast Kansas.

.DAY ONE...Today and Tonight.

Weather hazards expected...

  Elevated non thunderstorm wind risk.
  Elevated fire weather risk.

DISCUSSION...

Very windy conditions are expected to continue through the evening,
especially in western Missouri and southeast Kansas where some 
wind gusts over 45 mph will be possible. 30 to 40 mph winds are 
expected across the remainder of the area. A wind advisory is in 
effect for until midnight for western Missouri and southeast 
Kansas.

With the very dry fuels across the region due to the ongoing 
drought, combined with windy conditions and warm temperatures, 
elevated fire weather conditions are possible with rapid fire
spread if any fires develop.

.DAYS TWO THROUGH SEVEN...Monday through Saturday.

Widespread rainfall with embedded thunderstorms will spread 
across the entire region by Monday night and continue into early 
Wednesday morning. Many locations could receive over 2 inches of 
beneficial rainfall. This may lead to some localized flooding,
despite the recent drought conditions.

.SPOTTER INFORMATION STATEMENT...

  Spotter activation will not be needed through tonight.
