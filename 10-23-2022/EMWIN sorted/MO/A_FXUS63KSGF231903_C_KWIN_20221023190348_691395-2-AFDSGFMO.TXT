203 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Key Messages:

1. Very windy conditions will persist through the evening hours,
with elevated fire weather behavior continuing.

2. Some record warmest lows will be possible Monday morning.

3. Widespread rainfall across the area Monday-Tuesday.



.SHORT TERM...(This evening through Monday)
Issued at 203 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

A few high based showers and embedded storms were developing over
eastern Kansas just west of the CWA. Have updated forecast for
extreme southeast Kansas through about 3 pm to cover for this.
These areas may see some enhanced winds, in an area where winds
have already gusted over 50 mph.

Subtropical jet and northern stream jet were beginning to merge
over the Rockies early this afternoon. Strong surface low was
located over western Nebraska with a strong pressure gradient out
ahead of the low across eastern Kansas and western Missouri. The
low will begin to lift northeast this evening, but a low level jet
is expected to develop this evening over eastern Kansas which will
keep the higher winds in place through the evening. Will maintain
the wind advisory for the same areas through midnight.

While moisture is quite a bit higher than yesterday with dewpoints
in the mid to upper 50s, with the winds howling, rapid fire spread
is still possible with any fires that develop and we are still
messaging an elevated fire danger. Have already had a couple of
hot spots develop over the area.

The strong south winds and increased cloud cover tonight will keep
lows in the low to mid 60s tonight which will be near or break
some record warmest lows on Monday.

We should start to see the first main wave of precipitation begin
to move into the area on Monday morning as the surface front
slowly moves into the area and upper level energy out ahead of the
main trough enters the region from the west/southwest. Moisture
advection from both the Pacific and Gulf will drive PW values into
the 1.5 to 1.8 in. range which is well above the 90th percentile
for this time of year, so the potential will be there for heavy
rain as this system slowly moves through. While there will be
plenty of shear with this highly dynamic system, instability will
be lacking for any kind of organized severe weather weather.


.LONG TERM...(Monday Night through Sunday)
Issued at 203 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

The initially open upper wave is expected to close off Monday
night and then track slowly northeast, eventually into southeast
Missouri during the day on Tuesday. Moisture is expected to
continue wrapping around the low with enough lift to maintain some
pops through Tuesday night over our eastern counties.

We are forecasting precipitation amounts from around 1.75" to
around 2.75", with some smaller pockets up to around 3.25" in
parts of south central Missouri with this storm system. This may
lead to some localized flooding, despite the recent drought
conditions.

This system will then quickly lift northeast out of the area on
Wednesday, with another upper wave pushing into the western U.S.
This system may bring some additional rainfall to the area late in
the week into the weekend, but some models are bringing the main
energy and precipitation more south of the area.

Temperatures will be cooler on Tuesday behind the front and with
the continued cloud cover and rainfall, with most areas remaining
in the 50s for highs.

Will warm back into the 60s from Wednesday through the end of the
week into the weekend.

.AVIATION...(For the 18Z TAFS through 18Z Monday afternoon)
Issued at 1153 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

For the 18z TAFS, winds will continue to be the main aviation
hazard today and tonight as a strong area of low pressure lifts
northeast closer to the forecast area. Wind gusts over 40kts will
be possible at JLN/SGF through the late evening. Convection will
begin to arrive in the western CWA towards moning including JLN
and possibly into SGF by the end of the TAF.
