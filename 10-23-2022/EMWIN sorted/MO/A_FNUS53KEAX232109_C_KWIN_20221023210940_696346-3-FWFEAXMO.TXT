Fire Weather Planning Forecast For NE Kansas/NW Missouri
National Weather Service Kansas City/Pleasant Hill MO
409 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

.DISCUSSION...

Fire weather danger remains elevated this afternoon thanks to cured fuels and
strong wind gusts up to 50 mph. RH values are a bit higher this afternoon, with
most locations around 40 percent, but we have still seen some hot spots on satellite
this afternoon. Widespread 1 to 2 inches of rain is expected tomorrow morning through
tomorrow evening and with cooler temperatures, lighter winds, and RH values above critical
thresholds, fire weather concerns should improve considerably.
