Key Messages:

1. Increased fire potential again today into the early evening 
across the area.

2. Some record warmest lows possible again tonight.

3. Very windy conditions today, with a wind advisory over the 
western 3 tiers of counties.

4. Widespread rainfall expected Monday-Tuesday.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)
Issued at 216 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Deepening low pressure in the plains today will cause the surface
pressure gradient to tighten as the surface low slides east 
across the plains. Winds will increase through the day with wind 
advisory criteria being met by mid morning and continuing into the
evening hours. A wind advisory remains in effect for the western 
portions of the area and into southeastern Kansas. current 
expectations are for sustained winds over 30 mph and gusts over 45
for those areas.

Cloud cover, increasing through the day, should help limit 
temperatures to the upper 70s to low 80s for most locations.
Slowly increasing low level moisture will also provide limited 
relief for fire weather concerns. However, with the very dry 
fuels across the region due to the ongoing drought, combined with 
windy conditions and warm temperatures, isolated fire starts will 
remain possible. It may be possible that a large fire could 
develop thanks to the very windy conditions today despite 
increased relative humidity levels.

Precipitation is expected to hold off until after midnight and
into early Monday with the main front/upper wave well off to the 
west on today. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 216 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

A surface front will begin to slowly move into southeastern Kansas
and the Missouri Ozarks through the day Monday. The main upper 
wave is still expected to be southwest of the area however, with 
strong southwest flow aloft over the area. 

Rain should begin to spread across the area early Monday morning
and move over all of the Ozarks through Monday. Precipitable 
Water values continue to be in the 1.5-1.6 inch value range 
through Tuesday. Instability with this system remains rather 
limited with severe storms not expected. There will be a potential
of heavy rain at times however that will be spread over a two day
period. This may provide some needed relief to the ongoing 
drought conditions. 

Probabilities of 1-2 inches of rain are still in the likely 
category, with local areas of 3 inches possible. The best 
rainfall totals remain expected to the southeast of the 
Interstate 44 corridor. 

The upper level low will begin to lift northeast late Tuesday and
should clear out of the entire area on Tuesday evening. 
Temperatures will be much cooler Tuesday with rain/clouds and 
cooler air behind the cold front. Highs will only be in the mid 
50s to low 60s.

A transition to a zonal pattern will occur for the middle of the week
into the becomes southwesterly aloft as we head towards next 
weekend. A shortwave could bring some additional rainfall to the 
area by late in the week, however, moisture will be limited with
this system and the track will need to be watched as well.
 
Temperatures are expected to moderate back into the low to mid 60s
by Thursday into next weekend with mainly dry weather currently 
expected.
