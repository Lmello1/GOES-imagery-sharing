...A Red Flag Warning is in effect for portions of southern Colorado
through 8PM today...

.Discussion...

Critical fire weather conditions will exist Sunday morning through
early evening over the Interstate 25 corridor and eastern plains.  
Strong winds will progress eastward onto the eastern plains during 
the morning and continue into the afternoon.  Minimum daytime humidities 
will be around 15 percent over the plains and Interstate 25 corridor 
with wind gusts in excess of 40 mph.

For Monday and Tuesday, winds will generally be light, decreasing the 
threat for critical fire weather conditions.  A storm system will move
into the region on Wednesday and Thursday with increasing winds, but 
with a chance for precipitation, especially over and near the mountains.
Dry weather returns for Friday and Saturday with generally light winds.

For smoke dispersion...On Sunday, strong winds will result in generally
excellent dispersion during the day.  On Monday, winds will be lighter
with generally good dispersion over the district. 

--- thunderstorms imply strong gusty and erratic winds ---
