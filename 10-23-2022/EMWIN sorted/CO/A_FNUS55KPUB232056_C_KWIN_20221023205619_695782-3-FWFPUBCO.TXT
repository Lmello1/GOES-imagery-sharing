National Weather Service Pueblo Co
256 PM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022

...A Red Flag Warning is in effect for portions of southern Colorado
through 8PM today...

.Discussion...

Critical fire weather conditions continue through around 8PM this 
evening, which is when the Red Flag Warning expires. Otherwise, 
critical fire weather conditions are not expected throughout the 
rest of the forecast period. 

Lingering rain and showers will continue through the overnight over 
the mountains and by tomorrow afternoon there will be scattered rain 
and snow showers over the southern plains and the Raton Mesa. 
Minimal impacts are expected. 

Another shot at more snow is possible later this week from Thursday 
through Friday, but there is still some uncertainty of the storm 
track. 

Smoke dispersals tomorrow afternoon will be Very Good over the Wet 
Mountain Valley, the San Luis Valley, and the far eastern plains, 
but the rest of the region will have Poor to Fair smoke dispersals.
