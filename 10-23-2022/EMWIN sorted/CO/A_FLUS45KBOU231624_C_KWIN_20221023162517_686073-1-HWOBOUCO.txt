This hazardous weather outlook is for northeast and north central
Colorado.

.DAY ONE...Today and Tonight

Windy and dry conditions will lead to critical fire weather 
conditions across the eastern plains, south of a Denver to Akron
line. Winds could gust to 60 mph, generating areas of blowing dust
across the eastern plains of Colorado.

In the high country, snow is expected through early Monday 
morning. The heaviest snow will fall over Western Jackson county, 
including Rabbit Ears pass. High mountain passes along US-40 and 
I-70 are expected to become slick later today with icy and snow 
covered roads. 

.DAYS TWO THROUGH SEVEN...Monday through Saturday

Gusty winds are expected late Monday into Monday night. Areas in the 
northern Front Range mountains and foothills could see gusts up to 
55 mph late Monday night. Low temperatures Monday night will be near 
freezing across the I-25 corridor so it is possible that a freeze 
occurs in areas that haven't seen one already. 

A system will bring light to moderate snow amounts to the northern 
mountains late Wednesday through Thursday. This system will also 
bring a mix of rain and snow showers to the foothills and plains and 
light snow accumulation is possible there. 

.SPOTTER INFORMATION STATEMENT...

Spotter activation will not be needed today or tonight.
