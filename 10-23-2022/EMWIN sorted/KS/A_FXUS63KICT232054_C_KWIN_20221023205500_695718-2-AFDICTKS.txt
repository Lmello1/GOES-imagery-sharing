.SHORT TERM...(This evening through Wednesday night)
Issued at 351 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Key Details:

* A Red Flag Warning is in effect for central and south-central 
  Kansas until 8 PM CDT this evening

* A high wind warning is in effect for Russell and Barton Counties. 
  A wind advisory is in effect for the rest of the CWA.

* A dust advisory is in effect for portions of central Kansas

* A conditional severe risk will be possible today while beneficial 
  rainfall is expected for southeast Kansas.

An upper level trough currently resides over the U.S Four Corners 
region with a potent shortwave that ejected into the Northern and 
Central Plains today. This shortwave led to lee cyclogenesis and an 
anomalously low surface low pressure. The shortwave trough will 
continue to move northeast evening and as it does a potent low level 
jet will develop over central and south-central Kansas with 60-70kt 
across this area. The CAMs and especially HRRR and RAP show lapse 
rates from 950-700mb 7 c/km or higher as well as good momentum 
transfer. This will help mix those winds to the surface and some 
areas may approach high wind warning criteria tonight.

Only subtle precipitation trends have been noted, however with such 
a sharp cutoff expected a 15 to 20 miles shift could make a 
significant difference. There has been a trend to slow the front a 
couple of hours, which would allow heavier precip to move further 
west. These trends will need to be monitored into the now-cast 
period. Confidence is far higher that those east of the Kansas 
Turnpike and especially east of the Flint Hills will see beneficial 
rainfall, perhaps in the two to three inch range.


We should see weather clear out across the area by midday Tuesday. 
Fall like weather will continue Tuesday and Wednesday with mostly 
clear skies and quiet conditions.


.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Sunday)
Issued at 351 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Little change in thought from the previous long range forecast. It 
does appear that we will keep an active pattern with another trough 
expected to move through Thursday into Friday and perhaps another 
one Saturday into Sunday. Although there isn't a strong signal for 
rain in the extended, there should be a few chances coming up.&&

.AVIATION...(For the 18Z TAFS through 18Z Monday afternoon)
Issued at 330 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Very strong and gusty south winds will continue through the
evening. This will support areas of blowing dirt/dust, most
widespread over central and western portions of Kansas.
Additionally, a few thunderstorms may impact portions of central
and north-central Kansas late this afternoon-evening. A strong
low-level jet will support low-level wind shear within 2000 ft 
AGL for many locations tonight. Later tonight, expect a cold front
to switch winds to northwesterly, but not as strong as today.
Additionally, widespread showers with embedded thunderstorms will
spread northeast Monday, most prevalent generally along/southeast
of the KS Turnpike.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 351 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Extreme to catastrophic fire danger is expected to continue this 
afternoon. Strong gusty winds up to 60 mph have occurred and are 
ongoing. This will lead to fire concerns through the evening. A Red 
Flag Warning is still in effect through this evening for the Flint 
Hills and points west.
