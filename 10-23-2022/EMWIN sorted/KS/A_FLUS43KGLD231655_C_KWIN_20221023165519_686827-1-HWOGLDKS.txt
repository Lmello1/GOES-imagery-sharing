This hazardous weather outlook is for extreme southwest Nebraska...
northwest Kansas and east central Colorado.

.DAY ONE...TODAY...

A Red Flag Warning is in effect for the entire Tri-State Area. 
Expect southwesterly winds to continue with 30-40 mph sustained
speeds and gusts 45-55 mph including isolated 60 mph gusts into the 
afternoon and early evening. Critical to extremely critical fire 
weather conditions will allow for rapid fire growth and movement. 
Blowing dust is ongoing and expected to continue until shortly after
sunrise. Blowing dust and smoke from any fire starts will reduce 
visibility to a few miles or less as well as degrade air quality. 
Winds quickly shift northwesterly with a cold front moving through 
the area beginning around sunset to the few hours following.

.DAYS TWO THROUGH SEVEN...MONDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...

Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday afternoons will see a continuation of
elevated to near-critical fire weather conditions.

.SPOTTER INFORMATION STATEMENT...

Spotter activation is not needed, though any visibility reports from
blowing dust would be appreciated. Also report fires to local
dispatch.
