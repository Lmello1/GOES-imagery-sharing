.DISCUSSION...

For the remainder of today, critical to extreme fire weather
conditions remain across the area along with blowing dust. This
evening, a cold front will move across the area and rapidly change
directions to out of the north-northwest. Winds will then remain
gusty overnight and into tomorrow though relative humidity should
improve. So fire weather will remain a concern through the evening
with conditions improving a few hours after the front passes. The
next few days have elevated to near critical conditions with low
relative humidity and gusty winds not forecasted to coincide till
maybe Tuesday/Wednesday.
