...BLOWING DUST COULD REDUCE VISIBILITY...

Areas of blowing dust have been observed on satellite imagery
across central Kansas. This dust is likely to impact north 
central Kansas into the evening hours by reducing visibilities 
between 3 and 6 miles and making it difficult to be outside. If 
driving, slow down and exercise caution when encountering the 
blowing dust.
