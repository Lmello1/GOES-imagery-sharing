.DISCUSSION...
Issued at 303 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022


-Strong wind gusts through the evening of 40 to 50 MPH. Wind
 advisory in effect through 1 AM Monday, Red flag warning across 
 north central KS until 7 PM

-Isolated thunderstorms are possible this afternoon and into the 
early morning hours of Monday. A few could produce wind gusts of 60 
MPH.

-Cooler with a chances for showers on Monday, with the best chances 
across the eastern half of the area.

An intense upper level trough was lifting northeast across the high 
Plains. A deep surface and 850m low was located across SD and the 
tight pressure sfc pressure gradient was causing strong wind 
gusts of 38 to 48 MPH across the CWA this afternoon. This evening 
the LLJ at 2K to 3K ft will increase to near 70KTS. Thus the 
strong southerly wind gusts will continue into the evening as the 
boundary layer remains well mixed. A dryline was located across 
central KS, just west of the CWA this afternoon. The warm 
advection showers and few elevated storms will move northeast out
of the CWA after 3 PM. 

A few CAMs were showing storms forming along the 
dryline after 23Z. However the EML may provide a strong enough cap
to prevent isolated storms from forming late this afternoon early
evening. However, if storms do form they will tap into the 
stronger winds 2000 feet above the surface and may provide 
downdraft winds to 60 to 70 MPH. Even though MLCAPE is only 300 to
500 J/KG but any weak updraft could tap into the stronger winds
2000 feet above the surface. Otherwise, the better chance for 
storms may come as the surface cold front pushes southeast across 
the CWA later Tonight. The potential is there with the strong LLJ 
of 60 to 70 KTS for some downdraft outflows to produce winds gusts
of 60 MPH. But instability will remain low despite good low-level
vertical windshear.

frontogenesis northwest of the surface front, along with DCVA 
ahead of the H5 trough axis will provide periods of showers on 
Monday into Monday night across the CWA. The better rain chance 
will be across the eastern counties where 1/2 to 1 inch of 
rainfall may occur by late Monday. I can't rule out a few rumbles 
of thunder.

There will be another chance for rain late this week as an upper 
level trough digs east-southeast across the southern Plains late 
Thursday through Friday.

.AVIATION...(For the 18Z TAFS through 18Z Monday afternoon)
Issued at 1239 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Strong southerly winds will continue through this evening across
the terminals. Sustained winds will be southerly at 20 to 30 KTS
with gusts of 35 to 45 KTS. The winds will decrease after 7Z but
the winds 1500 feet above the surface will continue from the
southwest at 50 KTS, so there will be low-level wind shear after
7Z up through 12Z MON. I cannot rule out an isolated shower or
thunderstorm this evening through the overnight hours. A cold
front will pass southeast across the terminals through mid morning
hours of Monday and ceilings will drop to 3500 to 5000 feet with
occasional light showers.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 358 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

A Red Flag Warning will be in effect through 8 PM for the western
half of the CWA today. RH values in that area are forecast to be 
between 25 and 35 percent at their lowest this afternoon. While 
this is higher than our usual RFW criteria for RH, the very dry 
fuels and intense winds will set the stage for rapid fire spread 
if fires develop. Southwest winds will be sustained between 25 and
35 mph and could gusts to as high as 55 mph today. Thus, a RFW 
will continue in coordination with the Kansas Forest Service.
