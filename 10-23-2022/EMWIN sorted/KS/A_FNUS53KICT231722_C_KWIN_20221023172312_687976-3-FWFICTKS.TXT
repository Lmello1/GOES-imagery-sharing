.DISCUSSION...
Issued at 302 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Today: Extreme to catastrophic grassland fire danger is expected 
throughout the day. Despite RH values being a somewhat limiting 
factor around 20 to 45%, warm temperatures ranging from the
mid-80s 
to the low 90s and gusty winds around 45 to 60 mph working in 
conjunction with very dry vegetation from exceptional drought 
conditions will certainly lead to critical fire weather
conditions.
