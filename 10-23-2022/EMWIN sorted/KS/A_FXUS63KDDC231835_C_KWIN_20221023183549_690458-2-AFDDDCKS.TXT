.SHORT TERM...(This evening through Monday)
Issued at 115 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Strong winds this Sunday afternoon decreasing this evening. Will 
be monitoring the chance for thunderstorms east of Dodge City 
this evening and again early Monday morning. 
 
Strong winds early this Sunday evening will begin to gradually
decrease.  Various BUFR sounding Meteograms remains in good 
agreement with past runs in the surface winds decreasing quickly
between 00z and 03z Monday once the boundary layer winds 
decouple. These strong winds combined with ongoing dry conditions 
support keeping the Red Flag Warning going through this evening. 
Wind gusts via momentum transfer still suggest winds of around 60 
mph will be possible through late day so the High Wind Warning
also looks good. In addition to the strong gusty winds...blowing 
dust will also be an issue across all of southwest Kansas. Visibility
late Sunday and early Sunday evening as low as of 1 mile or less 
will be possible, especially west of highway 283. 

East of Dodge City late today we will be monitoring the chance 
for some evening convection along a surface boundary/dryline that 
most of the CAMS have located from near Larned to Coldwater. 
Deep mixing potential this afternoon will result in little to no 
CIN. This plus improving 0-1km moisture convergence developing 
late day along this boundary and mid level lapse rates greater 
than 7.5C/km it does appears that there will be a slight chance 
for a few isolated to widely scattered storms to be possible. 
Should storms develop late day it appears that wind gusts of 60 
mph or even a little strong will be the main hazards. Isolate hail
less than nickels can not be ruled out. 
 
These evening thunderstorms over south central Kansas will taper 
off/move east by sunset tonight as a surface cold front drops 
south across northwest Kansas. This cold front will cross 
southwest Kansas during the overnight hours as an upper level 
trough lifts northeast out of the Central Rockies and moves into 
the Northern Plains. The main upper low will still be located in 
the 4 corners region. Gusty southwest winds Sunday evening will 
shift to the north with the passage of this cold front and briefly
increase. Precipitation chances with the cold frontal passage 
tonight look small (<20%) but a better opportunity for 
precipitation appears to be possible early in the day on Monday 
(30-40%) across south central Kansas given improving moisture and 
850/700mb frontogenesis ahead of the main upper low that will be 
exiting the four corners region and moving out into the Texas 
Panhandle during the day on Monday. 


.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)
Issued at 115 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

In the later periods the main item of interest in precipitation 
chances late week. 

Ensemble clusters are still in decent agreement with an upper 
level trough crossing Kansas and Oklahoma Kansas late week. The 
most notable difference early today between the latest ensembles 
and the previous runs is that the majority of the clusters now 
have the trough trending towards being stronger and tracking more 
south (crossing Oklahoma) as it moves out into the Plains during 
the period from 00z Friday to 00z Saturday. This solution 
continues to favor a chance for precipitation across south central
and portions of southwest Kansas but the higher probability for 
accumulating rainfall, rainfall totals >0.20”, looks to be focused
south and southeast of Dodge City. Timing of this improving 
precipitation chances for south central and southwest Kansas still
will be from 00z Friday through 00z Saturday. Also given the 
latest ensemble solution, the current NBM forecast may be a little
optimistic with the precipitation chances as far north as the 
I-70 corridor but still some widely scattered showers (20%) will 
be possible that far north. The best opportunity for accumulating 
precipitation (>0.20”) will however be focused near the Oklahoma 
border and across south central Kansas. 

As for temperatures this upcoming work week into the weekend…it 
looks like once again after a cool start to the work week the 
temperatures will be rebounding back to more seasonal levels 
(highs in the upper 60s) late week. Then another brief cool down 
will return as the next significant upper trough crosses western 
Kansas/Oklahoma on Friday. The cool down Friday and Saturday 
currently does not look to be very dramatic given the 850mb 
ensemble temperature anomalies and westerly downslope flow 
forecast to quickly return to eastern Colorado and western Kansas.

.AVIATION...(For the 18Z TAFS through 18Z Monday afternoon)
Issued at 1200 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Wind gusts from the momentum transfer from BUFR soundings this 
morning were doing a good job with the strong gusty winds
occurring across southwest Kansas at 17z Sunday. Using this as a 
guide these strong winds will continue through sunset and then 
taper off as the boundary layer decouples. Blowing dust will 
reduce visibility at times today and may brief drop the visibility
to one mile or less. The prevailing visibility this afternoon 
will likely stay in the 2-4sm range. A cold front will cross 
southwest Kansas early tonight. As this boundary passes the 
southwest winds will shift to the northwest. Gusty northwest winds
will be possible for several hours behind this cold front early 
Monday morning.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 115 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

At 18z Sunday southwest winds were gusting at times in the 50 to
60 mph range with widespread blowing dust occurring due to the
expected dry period across western Kansas. A Red Flag Warning is
in effect until 9 pm CDT this Sunday evening and at this time sees
no reason to trim or cancel any part of this warning.
