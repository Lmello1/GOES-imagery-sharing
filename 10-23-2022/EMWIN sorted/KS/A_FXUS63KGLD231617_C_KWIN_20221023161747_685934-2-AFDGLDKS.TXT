.UPDATE...
Issued at 1015 AM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Blowing dust is currently reducing visibilities to 1.75SM in
Burlington within a narrow plume. GFS 0.5-1km wind speeds of at
least 45kts are advertised in this area currently, in line with
local research findings for high impact blowing dust/dust storm
events. Historically over the past year or two, GFS model has
handled these events the best. 

For the remainder of the day, this area of favored wind speeds
continues for Dundy, Hitchcock, Cheyenne KS and CO, Rawlins,
Sherman and Kit Carson counties. So, would expect additional
plumes to develop and impact these counties. With that in mind,
I've gone ahead and issued a Blowing Dust Advisory. 

Will be watching areas from Hill City to Oakley and Tribune south
as well where visibilities to the south of our area already
reduced in blowing dust.

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Tuesday)
Issued at 332 AM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Southwesterly flow aloft today as the upper-level trough approaches 
the region. Strong winds out of the southwest 30-40 mph sustained, 
gusting 45-55 mph and minimum RH in the 15-20% range result in 
critical to extremely critical fire weather. In addition to the 
dangerous fire weather, blowing dust is likely to develop by mid to 
late morning, reducing visibilities and air quality. Highest winds 
and also greatest blowing dust concerns are expected over eastern 
Colorado and locations south of I-70 where localized gusts up to 55 
mph are possible. Afternoon highs will be in the 70s west to near 90 
degrees over the east. Timing of cold front passage continues to be 
around sunset into a few hours following. With FROPA, expect a wind 
shift to the northwest and far northwestern portions of the area to 
see a slight chance for rain showers. Overnight lows fall into the 
30s to mid-40s.

Winds aloft continue southwesterly into Monday before the upper-
trough axis moves through Monday evening/night. Northerly surface 
winds remain somewhat breezy into the afternoon with gusts up to the 
mid-30s (mph) possible. Elevated fire weather conditions possible 
despite minimum RH values in the upper-teens to low-20s. Afternoon 
highs will be in the 50s to near 60. Overnight lows fall into the 
20s to mid-30s.

On Tuesday, flow aloft is out of the northwest to west as the upper-
low continues east. Wind gusts could reach 25-30 mph in the 
afternoon, and with minimum RH in the 15-20% range, again could be 
looking at elevated to near-critical fire weather concerns. 
Afternoon highs climb into the 60s. 

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Saturday)
Issued at 339 AM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022

The westerly flow aloft Tuesday night turns southwesterly on
Wednesday and Wednesday night as an upper trough moves through the
Intermountain west and into the central Rockies. High pressure at
the surface extends southward from the northern Plains into the
southern Plains Tuesday night and moves over the eastern Plains on
Wednesday as a lee trough deepens along the Front Range in
response to the westerly flow over the Rockies and the approaching
upper trough. Dry and breezy conditions continue through Wednesday
with a potential for elevated fire weather conditions Wednesday
afternoon.

By Wednesday night, the surface trough deepens into a closed low 
over southeast Colorado and southwest Kansas that moves into the 
southern High Plains with the upper trough moving over the High 
Plains by late Thursday. The upper trough continues eastward over 
the Plains states between Thursday night and Friday with a slight 
chance of light rain across the forecast area and a few flurries
possible over the western sections of the forecast area where 
temperatures dip below freezing as the main upper trough moves 
across the region. Surface high pressure moves into the forecast 
area with short wave ridging moving over the Rockies and High 
Plains by Friday. Friday night into Saturday model solutions lack 
consistency, but generally show west to southwest flow aloft over 
the central High Plains region with another lee surface trough 
beginning to develop.

Seasonable temperatures are expected trough the long term period
with highs in the middle 50s to middle 60s and lows in the upper
20s and 30s.

.AVIATION...(For the 12Z TAFS through 12Z Monday morning)
Issued at 531 AM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022

While VFR conditions will prevail at MCK and GLD through the 12Z 
TAF period, LLWS is expected prior to the morning temperature
inversion mixing out around 15Z. After 15Z, winds increase 
rapidly with strong southwest winds gusting as high as 45kts 
between 17Z-00Z. These strong winds could produce blowing dust 
that may decrease visibility below 6 miles. Confidence in less 
than VFR conditions due to blowing dust is not high enough to 
bring visibility values down lower than 6 miles at this time. 
Winds will decrease during the evening hours as the sun sets and 
temperatures cool, but are expected to remain between 15-25kts as 
they turn to the northwest by 05Z.
