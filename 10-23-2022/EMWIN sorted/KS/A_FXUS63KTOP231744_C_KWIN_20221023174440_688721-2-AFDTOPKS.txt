.DISCUSSION...
Issued at 358 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Forecast Highlights:

-A Red Flag Warning and Wind Advisory are in effect for portions of 
the CWA today.

-A few severe thunderstorms are possible this evening. More 
widespread rainfall is expected in eastern KS tomorrow.

Forecast Discussion:

An active weather day is expected across Kansas today. At 09Z (4 AM 
CDT), an amplified mid-level trough was moving eastward from the 
Intermountain West toward the Northern Plains. A deep 989 mb surface 
low was located near Cheyenne, WY. A very tight surface pressure 
gradient was evident on surface charts between the deepening surface 
low to the west and a surface ridge over the far eastern US. 

A cold front will progress eastward across KS late today and tonight 
as the aforementioned system moves northeast into the Dakotas. Ahead 
of the front, southwest winds are expected to exceed advisory 
criteria, sustained between 25 and 35 mph with gusts between 45 and 
55 mph. The HREF ensemble mean keeps gusts near 50 mph into the 
nighttime hours. That seems reasonable given the pressure gradient 
and position of the boundary. Thus, we have extended the wind 
advisory from noon until 1 AM tonight.

The strong winds were also a factor is deciding to upgrade the Fire 
Weather Watch to a Red Flag Warning for the western half of the CWA 
today. Minimum RH values are not as low as our typical warning 
criteria, but in coordination with fire partners and given the 
strong winds and very dry landscape, a warning was deemed necessary. 
See more details in the fire section below.

The next hazard to focus on will be the possibility of a few severe 
thunderstorms this evening east of the front. There remains 
uncertainty on whether storms will develop with some convective 
inhibition in place, but if forcing becomes strong enough, a few 
storms could develop. Hi-res model solutions show around 500 J/Kg of 
MUCAPE, and an enhancement in the lower atmospheric wind fields this 
evening would increase low level shear that could support 
supercellular structures. Damaging wind gusts look to be the main 
concern if storms develop in this environment.

A more widespread batch of rainfall is expected to move into eastern 
KS tomorrow as the main upper level trough approaches. The higher 
QPF still looks to be south and east of the Kansas Turnpike where 
around one inch of rain is possible. The rest of the week will bring 
closer to average temperatures with highs mainly in the 60s. There 
will be another chance for precipitation late in the week as a 
system passes south of the area.

.AVIATION...(For the 18Z TAFS through 18Z Monday afternoon)
Issued at 1239 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Strong southerly winds will continue through this evening across
the terminals. Sustained winds will be southerly at 20 to 30 KTS
with gusts of 35 to 45 KTS. The winds will decrease after 7Z but
the winds 1500 feet above the surface will continue from the
southwest at 50 KTS, so there will be low-level wind shear after
7Z up through 12Z MON. I cannot rule out an isolated shower or
thunderstorm this evening through the overnight hours. A cold
front will pass southeast across the terminals through mid morning
hours of Monday and ceilings will drop to 3500 to 5000 feet with
occasional light showers.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 358 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

A Red Flag Warning will be in effect from 11 AM to 8 PM for the 
western half of the CWA today. RH values in that area are forecast 
to be between 25 and 35 percent at their lowest this afternoon. 
While this is higher than our usual RFW criteria for RH, the very 
dry fuels and intense winds will set the stage for rapid fire spread 
if fires develop. Southwest winds will be sustained between 25 and 
35 mph and could gusts to as high as 55 mph today. Thus, a RFW was 
issued in coordination with the Kansas Forest Service.
