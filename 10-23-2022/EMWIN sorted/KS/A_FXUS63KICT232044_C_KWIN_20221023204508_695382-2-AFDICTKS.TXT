Key Messages Over the Next 7 Days:

* Dangerous fire weather conditions are expected on today with 
  strong winds and near-record high temperatures.

* Potential increasing for appreciable rainfall along and east of 
  the Kansas Turnpike on Monday.

* Potential for additional rain chances Thurs evening into Friday.

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Tuesday night)
Issued at 302 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Today: A potent mid/upper trough is digging into the western CONUS 
and will be the catalyst for multiple hazards today. Strong 
southwesterly mid/upper flow associated with the leading shortwave 
kicking out into the northern plains will support lee cyclogenesis 
over northeast Colorado and will subsequently tighten the pressure 
gradient across the central plains. This along with deep mixing in 
the afternoon, especially across central Kansas behind the dryline, 
will likely support strong winds with gusts around 50 to 60 mph. 
Despite RH values in the 30s and 40s for most of the area, these 
gusty conditions along with near record high temps and exceptional 
drought conditions will lead to critical fire weather concerns (more 
details in the Fire Wx discussion below). Some cloud cover across 
south-central and southeast Kansas may limit winds a bit by limiting 
deep mixing, but 45 to 50 mph gusts are still anticipated for these 
areas through the afternoon and evening hours.

The rain/thunderstorm forecast is a bit trickier for today. CAMs are 
latching onto a weak area of mid-level moisture transport racing 
across the area during the late morning/early afternoon hours and a 
few light showers are possible from this feature. Though these 
showers won't bring any kind of meaningful rainfall given very dry 
conditions near the surface, they may be able to mix down locally 
stronger wind gusts across portions of south-central and southeast 
Kansas. Later in the afternoon, a dryline be be positioned from 
north-central to southwest Kansas. Multiple model soundings indicate 
areas just east of the dryline may become uncapped given robust 
diurnal heating and steady mid-level cooling. This would suggest the 
door is open for at least a high-based storm or two to develop along 
the dryline and mix down severe wind gusts in excess of 60 mph. As 
we approach the nighttime hours, better moisture will reside in the 
warm sector by the time the cold front arrives. This should 
marginally increase storm coverage from northeast to south-central 
Kansas, and a couple storms may be strong to severe. Main threats 
with the strongest nighttime convection will be penny to quarter 
size hail and 50 to 60 mph wind gusts.

Monday-Tuesday: Monday's rain forecast is beginning to come into 
focus, and global models are beginning to converge on what will be 
the most likely scenario. Another shortwave embedded within the 
larger scale mid/upper trough will traverse northwest over the 
sweeping cold front that will be moving through the region on 
Monday. Timing of these features will be crucial for the exact 
locations of the heaviest rainfall. With reasonable confidence, 
areas along and southeast of the Kansas Turnpike will be the most 
likely to see appreciable rainfall amounts throughout the day on 
Monday. A few storms in southeast Kansas (along/near the cold front) 
have a narrow window of opportunity to be strong with small hail and 
gusty winds being the main threats during the early afternoon hours. 
The rainfall forecast for areas along and west of the Kansas 
Turnpike remains uncertain, and perhaps a bit bleak as the trough is 
expected to move east quickly before pivoting northward over 
Missouri and Illinois. By Monday night, the bulk of the rain will 
push off to the east with the advancing cold front. Tuesday is 
increasingly looking dry and cool with the exception of southeast 
Kansas still experiencing some lingering showers in the morning 
hours. 

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Saturday)
Issued at 302 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

A period of dry weather with near normal temps (highs in the 
mid/upper 60s) will last through Thursday afternoon. For Thursday 
evening through much of Friday, global models are signaling another 
trough digging into the Rockies potentially bringing another chance 
for wetting rainfall across the region. However, details in the 
forecast this far out will likely need to be refined in the coming 
days.

.AVIATION...(For the 18Z TAFS through 18Z Monday afternoon)
Issued at 330 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Very strong and gusty south winds will continue through the
evening. This will support areas of blowing dirt/dust, most
widespread over central and western portions of Kansas.
Additionally, a few thunderstorms may impact portions of central
and north-central Kansas late this afternoon-evening. A strong
low-level jet will support low-level wind shear within 2000 ft 
AGL for many locations tonight. Later tonight, expect a cold front
to switch winds to northwesterly, but not as strong as today.
Additionally, widespread showers with embedded thunderstorms will
spread northeast Monday, most prevalent generally along/southeast
of the KS Turnpike.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 302 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Today: Extreme to catastrophic grassland fire danger is expected 
throughout the day. Despite RH values being a somewhat limiting 
factor around 20 to 45%, warm temperatures ranging from the mid-80s 
to the low 90s and gusty winds around 45 to 60 mph working in 
conjunction with very dry vegetation from exceptional drought 
conditions will certainly lead to critical fire weather conditions.
