.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Sunday evening)
Issued at 1137 PM CDT Sat Oct 22 2022

Increasing upper level divergence due to a digging trough to the
west is turning flow aloft more southwesterly ahead of the next
storm system ongoing through the Rockies. Breezy south winds with
a decent gradient over the CWA overnight 10-20 mph under mainly
clear skies. Low temperatures Sunday morning in the upper 40s to
near 60. Winds will start to increase by mid morning across the
entire CWA as the low level jet strengthens with daytime heating
and deepening of the leeside trough over eastern Colorado. Wind
gusts up to 40-50 mph expected by mid day with the peak up to 60
mph possible during the peak heating of the afternoon hours.
Blowing dust and fire danger will be the main threats during this
time frame with ongoing fire weather and high wind headlines
issued. Expect winds to diminish some towards sunset with
radiational cooling seeing gusts up to 20-30mph into the overnight
hours. Afternoon high temperatures will once again be well into
the 80s with the aid of the downsloping component of the southwest
winds. 

A cold front will begin to push through the northern portions of
the CWA after midnight making its way south to southeast into the
early morning hours Monday. Isolated thunderstorms are expected
for southeastern counties of the CWA early Monday morning along
the cold front with severe weather not expected at this time due
to timing of the FROPA. On the backside of the low, expect ongoing
rain with the CAA in its wake. Isolated and light in nature, QPF
amounts are not impressive with the highest expected into south
central Kansas up to a quarter inch possible. Cooler Monday in the
wake of the aforementioned cold front only in the 50s with
overnight lows into Tuesday morning down into the 30s. Breezy
north winds throughout the day Monday gusting up to 20-30 mph
 overnight into the long term forecast to less than 10mph with 
improving skies during that time frame. Continued cooler 
temperatures and little to no precipitation chances ahead in the 
long term with little to no drought relief expected at this time. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 110 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Mainly quiet weather in the long term forecast as upper level
ridging builds back in from the Rockies giving way to the
continued dry northwest flow aloft regime. Mild temperatures being
more seasonable for the end of October with morning lows in the
30s to low 40s and highs into the 60s. No significant wind events
expected but a weak cold front will push through late Thursday
afternoon and evening that will briefly turn winds out of the
north but have little to impact on temperatures through the end of
the work week and into next weekend. Minor precipitation chances
favoring eastern counties into central and south central portions
of the state tapping into better low level moisture due to the
aforementioned northwest flow aloft. Otherwise, the long term
outlook will remain mainly dry for much of the CWA with continued
seasonable temperatures.

.AVIATION...(For the 18Z TAFS through 18Z Monday afternoon)
Issued at 1200 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Wind gusts from the momentum transfer from BUFR soundings this 
morning were doing a good job with the strong gusty winds
occurring across southwest Kansas at 17z Sunday. Using this as a 
guide these strong winds will continue through sunset and then 
taper off as the boundary layer decouples. Blowing dust will 
reduce visibility at times today and may brief drop the visibility
to one mile or less. The prevailing visibility this afternoon 
will likely stay in the 2-4sm range. A cold front will cross 
southwest Kansas early tonight. As this boundary passes the 
southwest winds will shift to the northwest. Gusty northwest winds
will be possible for several hours behind this cold front early 
Monday morning.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 1148 PM CDT Sat Oct 22 2022

Significant fire weather concerns for Sunday during the late
morning to early evening hours. Increasing south to southwest
winds by mid morning gusting up to 30-40 mph pushing 50 mph by
noon. Peak gusts up to 60 mph expected during the strongest
heating of the afternoon for points along and west of the Hwy 183
corridor. With afternoon high temperatures pushing well into the
80s, minimum relative humidity values will drop into the 15-20
percent range with the lowest west of the Hwy 83 corridor. Winds
will diminish towards sunset Sunday evening with 20-30 mph gusts
by midnight. A cold front will push through after midnight
northwest to southeast through the early Monday morning hours
turning winds northerly and continuing to gust up to 20-30 mph.
For any fires that spark Sunday, the sudden timing of the wind
shift will be critical if still ongoing. Burning of any kind is
highly discouraged at this time with high wind and red flag
conditions expected for much of the viewing area late Sunday
morning through the early evening hours.
