.SHORT TERM...
(This evening through Tuesday) 
Issued at 225 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

A rather complex synoptic pattern is emerging as a long wave
trough over the Northern/Central Rockies gradually moves northeast
into the Northern Plains. A shortwave rounding the base of the 
parent trough will break away during the day Monday and will dig 
east-southeast into the Southern Plains while rapidly 
strengthening. In addition, the remnants of Hurricane Roslyn will 
merge with the Westerlies and eject northeast across West Texas 
and into Oklahoma and Kansas ahead of the Four Corners trough by 
midday Monday.

In response to these upper lows, a strong surface trough has 
developed over the Plains resulting in a very tight pressure 
gradient. Southerly winds will continue to gust in excess of 20 
kts, especially across Southeast Oklahoma and East Texas, through 
the overnight hours before wind speeds increase areawide Monday as
the pressure gradient tightens again ahead of an approaching cold
front. Sustained wind speeds should be between 15 and 20 kts with
gusts between 20 and 30 kts. For the most part, we should remain 
below Wind Advisory criteria.

As the remnants of Roslyn emerge into the Plains, large scale
ascent will result in the rapid development of showers and
thunderstorms across Texas and Oklahoma. Some showers may begin to
affect areas along and north of Interstate 30 before noon Monday
morning. Rain chances will rapidly increase during the afternoon
and especially into Monday evening. As the upper trough moves
across the Texas Panhandle and into Oklahoma, a new surface low
should rapidly develop over North Texas along the cold front and
eject northeast across the forecast area Monday night and into
early Tuesday. This will result in a strong increase in both deep
layer shear, and especially shear in the 0-3 km layer. Overall
shear profiles are somewhat unidirectional, which will promote a
linear storm mode. Instability will be limited, but the strength
of the 0-3 km shear will support both a damaging wind threat and a
threat for line-embedded tornadoes. There is a great deal of
uncertainty regarding the tornado threat due to the limited
instability. The best time period for the severe weather risk
should be from just before midnight Monday evening through the
early morning hours of Tuesday. However, the fall severe weather 
season is prone to low- CAPE/high-shear events like this.

The most robust convection should exit to the east of the forecast
area by late Tuesday morning as the upper trough moves over and
across the ArkLaTex. Some wrap-around showers and thunderstorms
may also persist through midday Tuesday. The pressure gradient
will remain strong immediately behind the departing the cold 
front and surface low. West-northwest winds of 15 to 20 kts are 
likely during the day Tuesday, and a Wind Advisory may be needed, 
especially for portions of East Texas.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday Night through next Saturday) 
Issued at 225 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

The period begins with a NAEFS/ECMWF ensemble consensus that the 
closed upper low will be pulling northeast away from the area as 
high pressure moves in from the west on Tuesday Night. The area will 
be in a zonal mid-level pattern with a surface high slowly moving 
across the area Tuesday through Thursday. In this pattern, a dry 
forecast is in place through Thursday.

The weather pattern gets active again for Friday into Saturday as 
there is GFS/ECMWF/Canadian agreement that a closed low will push 
from the Desert Southwest into Texas on Friday and moving into the 
ArkLaTex by Saturday. While the timing and location of the upper low 
varies between the models, its still safe to say there will at least 
be a chance of showers and thunderstorms across the area. This will 
put the area in a southwest mid-level flow on Friday with a surface 
low and its associated warm front pushing into showers and 
thunderstorms into the area on Friday night into early Saturday. The 
low will begin to pull northeast of the area on Saturday. This 
system will need to be watched as a further northward position with 
more instability would be conducive to possible severe weather. 
However, at this time, instability seems to limit a severe threat 
and details remain uncertain at this forecast range. While initial 
showers and thunderstorms will push east of the area early on 
Saturday, in a cooler air mass behind the system, some wrap-around 
showers will be possible through the day on Saturday. 

For temperatures, in the wake of the low, highs will be around 5 
degrees below seasonal values on Wednesday and Thursday in the lower 
to mid 70s across much of the area. Increased cloud coverage and 
rain chances will limit high temps Friday into Saturday, in the 
upper 60s to lower 70s across much of the area. /04-Woodrum/

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1250 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Gusty southerly winds will persist for most of the period.
Sustained wind speeds may diminish slightly after sunset, but
winds gusts will likely continue to be in excess of 20 kts
through the overnight hours. While VFR conditions prevail
initially, the strong south winds will bring low clouds and MVFR
ceilings northward to all TAF sites sites after 24/06z. Flight
conditions should slowly improve back into the VFR range late in
the period as wind speeds increase once again with sustained
speeds between 15 and 20 kts with gusts between 20 and 30 kts.
Most terminals should remain precip-free through 24/18z, but a few
showers may begin to affect portions of Southeast Oklahoma and
extreme Northeast Texas near the end of this TAF cycle.
