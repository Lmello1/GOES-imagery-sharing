This Hazardous Weather Outlook is for south central Arkansas, 
southwest Arkansas, north central Louisiana, northwest Louisiana, 
southeast Oklahoma, east Texas and northeast Texas.

.DAY ONE...This afternoon and tonight.

Gusty south winds and low relative humidities will contribute to the
ignition and spread of wildfires across the region today given the 
the critically dry fuels in place. Outdoor burning activities are 
strongly discouraged.

.DAYS TWO THROUGH SEVEN...Monday through Saturday.

Showers and thunderstorms will begin to increase Monday across 
portions of East Texas, southeastern Oklahoma, and adjacent portions
of southwestern Arkansas, and will spread east across the remainder 
of the region Monday night and into Tuesday ahead of a cold front and
a strong upper level storm system. A few severe storms will be 
possible Monday night into Tuesday morning. Damaging winds should be 
the primary threat, but large hail is possible and an isolated 
tornado cannot be ruled out.

Scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms will be possible on 
Friday. This system will need to be monitored for a possible late
week severe weather threat. 

.SPOTTER INFORMATION STATEMENT...

Spotter activation may be needed Monday night into early Tuesday.
