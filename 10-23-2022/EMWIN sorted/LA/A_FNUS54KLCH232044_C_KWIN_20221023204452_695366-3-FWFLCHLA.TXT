.DISCUSSION...

Elevated southerly winds will continue today and Monday as the
pressure gradient remains tight between high pressure to the east
and lower pressures over the Plains. Strong return flow will drive
an airmass with higher dewpoints back into the region over the
coming days, with afternoon humidity values increasing to 50 to
60 percent through Monday. Rain chances return Monday with the
approach of our next cool front. After frontal passage, a high
pressure will build in with cooler drier air filtering in.
