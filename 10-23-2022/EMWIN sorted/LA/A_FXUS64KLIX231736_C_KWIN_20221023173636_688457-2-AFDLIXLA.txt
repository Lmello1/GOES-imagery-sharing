VFR conditions will continue for another 24 to 30 hours before we
may start to see some slight impacts from cigs. Until then any BKN
or OVC skies will be well abv 3k ft and should pose little if any
problems. Winds will be gusty this afternoon but will quickly
subside around sunset. /CAB/

Slight ridge building across the southeastern US. Temps have been 
moderating and the trend continues today as 500mb heights remain 
increased. Expecting another day with highs the upper 70s to low 
80s. Guidance was fairly close, so saw no reason to stray much from 
the deterministic NBM. The most recent KLIX upper air sounding shows 
pretty minimal moisture in place with PW near 0.7" which is drier 
than yesterday and near the 25th percentile for this time of year 
per SPC sounding climatology page. Thus, no rain ending out this 
weekend. Main focus of impactful weather is early next week.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday night through Saturday)
Issued at 315 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Moving into next week, models shows a trough dropping out of the 
Rockies and Monday evening and swinging through the lower 
Mississippi Valley. As it does so, it picks up and absorbs a weak 
closed low passing across the Baja of California. The trough will 
attempt to close off a low at the base of it as it tracks east 
Tuesday. Its placement will be fairly critical in terms of providing 
dynamics for severe weather current models show shear values to be 
sufficient but on the low end with 0-1km and 0-3km right around 30 
kts. 0-6km shear is quite a bit higher at 50kts and stronger than 
previous model runs. Latest model soundings show modest instability 
available with CAPE values a little over 1000J/KG and fairly weak 
lapse rates. That's probably the biggest hindrance in this setup. 
Pressure falls as a 1000mb surface low develops and moves through 
Arkansas will promote buoyancy locally. If these solutions do occur 
as current models suggest, probably looking at a marginal to slight 
risk for severe weather. The best chance will be mainly north of I-
12 where dynamics are better. QLCS type tornadoes and brief 
strong/severe wind gusts would be the most likely severe threats. 
Warm mid level temps will probably limit hail threat. It'll be a 
fairly short window of opportunity right along the broken squall 
line as upper 60 to lower 70 dewpoints appear to surge north just 
ahead of the boundary. Timing has been relatively consistent from 
run to run, so likely a late morning/early afternoon passage. 

Once the cold front sweeps through, looking at a few days of quiet 
fall weather until the next boundary approaches next weekend. Models 
appear to be showing some run to run consistency on this one. The 
setup again will be determined by the north/south track of the 
trough. GFS suggests a track of the upper low to be right along the 
northern Gulf Coast. Its so far south that the warm sector and thus 
stronger storms would stay offshore. ECMWF suggest a more northern 
track. Will need to monitor this one as we go into next week.

Winds have transitioned to onshore as surface ridge is now northeast 
of the region. It looks to stay in that position in reference to the 
local coastal waters this weekend through early next week. The next 
potential frontal passage likely not until early/middle of next 
week. The strength of the frontal boundary is still uncertain, but 
at the least would likely have exercise caution conditions for 12-24 
hours.
