This Hazardous Weather Outlook is for central Louisiana, south 
central Louisiana, southwest Louisiana, west central Louisiana and 
southeast Texas.

.DAY ONE...This afternoon and tonight.

Southerly winds will be elevated today as the area gets squeezed
between high pressure along the Atlantic coast and lower pressures
over the Plains...expect frequent gusts to around 20 MPH.

Otherwise, no hazardous weather is expected.

.DAYS TWO THROUGH SEVEN...Monday through Saturday.

Rain chances return to the forecast on Monday as moisture associated
with the remnants of East Pacific Hurricane Roslyn move into the
region. Showers and thunderstorms will then become widespread Monday
night into early Tuesday as our next cold front moves across the
area...at this time, much of the area has been placed under a Slight
Risk for severe weather during this time frame, with the biggest
threat being damaging wind gusts.

Dry weather will then persist until late in the week when our next
storm system aloft and accompanying cold front sweep through the
region.

.SPOTTER INFORMATION STATEMENT...

Spotter activation is not expected at this time.
