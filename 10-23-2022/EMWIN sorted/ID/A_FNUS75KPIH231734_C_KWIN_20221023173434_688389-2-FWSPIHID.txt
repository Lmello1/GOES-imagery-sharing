.DISCUSSION...The area may see a few lingering showers this afternoon
in the wake of an upper disturbance. Upstream we see a weak upper
ridge that will quickly move through tomorrow as snow showers work 
their way back into the Sawtooth Range. Winds will predominantly be
from the northwest, and a bit breezy in the afternoon with gusts to 
20 to 25 mph. Weather will again deteriorate on Wednesday with the
approach of another upper disturbance.
