.SHORT TERM...Tonight through Tuesday night...Dry conditions and
mostly clear skies under a passing shortwave ridge will allow for
another cold night. High clouds will increase Monday morning, but
will see enough clear skies and light winds tonight for a 
widespread freeze at lower elevations. Light precipitation will 
overspread the area Monday afternoon as a quick moving upper 
trough pushes in from the coast. To the north, snow levels will 
be 4500-5500 feet sloping up to around 7000 feet along the NV 
border. A general 1-3 inches of snow is expected above 4500 feet 
across the mountains of Baker county and the west-central and 
Boise mountains in Idaho. Precipitation tapers off early Tuesday 
morning as the trough exits. However the break will be short-lived
as a trailing upper wave moves into the Pac NW, spreading light 
precipitation over the area Tuesday night. Snow levels will start 
off around 4000 feet across the north to around 5500 feet along 
the NV border. Temperatures will hold around 10 degrees below 
normal through Tuesday.

.LONG TERM...Wednesday through Sunday...Conditions start off
unsettled as an upper trough digs through central Idaho on 
Wednesday. The mountains will see more light snow accumulation
with rain in the valleys. Snow levels will run around 4000 feet.
A weak shortwave ridge, followed by southwest flow will bring
drier weather Thursday and Friday. Another storm will enter the
Pac NW over the weekend, increasing the chance for precipitation.
Temperatures start around 10 degrees below normal, warming to near
normal over the weekend.
