.SHORT TERM...
(The rest of this afternoon and Tonight)
Issued at 221 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

An energetic upper level trough continues to dig into the Four
Corners Region this afternoon, with a strong diffluent upper jet
ejecting out across the Rockies and High Plains resulting in
continued deepening of a surface low over eastern Colorado. This
has resulted in a tight surface pressure gradient over our area
today as pressures continue to fall in advance of this system. The
tight gradient will maintain strong surface winds with gusts 
around 40-45 mph likely through this afternoon and well into the 
evening hours. The current Wind Advisory is still in good shape 
and will continue through 1 AM tomorrow morning. Strong southerly
flow has also allowed deep boundary layer moisture to continue to
stream into the area noted by dewpoints in the low to mid 60s. 
This has kept min RH values around 50% this afternoon, helping to
mitigate the fire threat somewhat this afternoon. However, high 
fire danger will continues due to the gusty winds, warm 
temperatures, and stressed vegetation. Near critical spread rates 
are still being observed for any fires that do ignite this 
afternoon. Winds will begin to relax a little after midnight as 
the surface low lifts northeast across the Central Plains, 
allowing the gradient to relax somewhat ahead of a cold frontal 
boundary. Temperatures will again be pretty warm tonight due to 
the increasing moisture and gusty winds. A few showers could 
develop late tonight across western portions of the forecast area,
but most rain should hold off until Monday morning.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Sunday)
Issued at 221 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Warm, moist ascent due in part to the remnants of Hurricane Roslyn 
interacting with the ejecting upper trough will stream north 
across eastern Oklahoma early Monday morning ahead of the frontal 
boundary. This should lead to the development of numerous showers 
by daybreak Monday across eastern Oklahoma with some embedded 
thunderstorms possible as well. Instability still looks to be 
rather limited across the area as deep tropical moisture and 
expansive cloud cover/showers will weaken lapse rates for much of 
the day Monday. A few breaks in showers late Monday morning could
lead to a few pockets of higher instability developing. As the 
cold front moves through later Monday morning into the afternoon, 
a solid line of showers and thunderstorms is expected to develop 
along the boundary. If some higher instability can develop, deep 
layer shear will be strong, so a few severe thunderstorms will be 
possible, mainly across southeast Oklahoma, with strong wind gusts
the main threat. High temperatures are expected to be experienced
early in the day with falling temps likely across northeast 
Oklahoma throughout the day and across southeast Oklahoma and 
western Arkansas during the afternoon hours. Anomalous PWAT 
values will lead to efficient rainfall production, with a 
widespread 1-2 inches expected during the day tomorrow, with any 
thunderstorms producing some locally higher amounts.

A relative lull in precip is expected to follow the passage of the
front Monday evening and into the early overnight hours before the
main upper trough moves out across northern Texas. Another round 
of showers and isolated thunderstorms will accompany the upper
low, with totals being a little less than the first round, but
still widespread and highly needed. When all is said and done,
overall rain totals will range from 1-3 inches across much of the
region, with up to 5 inches possible in some locations. A couple
of pleasant Fall days will follow the exit of this system on 
Wednesday and Thursday as highs top out in the upper 60s with
sunny skies. Another system remains on track for sometime late in
the week into next weekend, though uncertainty remains between the
various guidance and their ensembles on the track and timing of
the system.  However, some more rain chances seem likely across 
at least some portion of the area by Friday and Saturday.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1236 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

MVFR CIG has developed into MLC at this time, but should be short-
lived. Otherwise, all sites expected to be VFR through 08z. Gusty 
southerly wind to 35 kts most sites into this evening. MVFR CIGS 
develop across much of the area late tonight and continue through the
end of the forecast period. Showers and scattered TSRA overspread 
the area from west to east after 08z, continuing through 18z with 
areas of IFR CIG VSBY probable.
