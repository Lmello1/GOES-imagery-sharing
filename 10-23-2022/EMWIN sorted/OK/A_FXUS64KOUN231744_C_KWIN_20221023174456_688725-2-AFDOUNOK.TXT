.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 332 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Wind speeds will be on the increase late this morning through this
afternoon as a deep upper trough approaches from the west and a
lee surface low deepens over the Plains. The resulting surface 
pressure gradient will be fairly impressive. Thankfully, 
increasing mid to high clouds may inhibit heating/mixing the first
half of the day over central and northern OK. The exception may 
be across far northwestern OK. Regardless, a Wind Advisory has 
been issued mainly along and north of I-40 where gusts around 
50-55 mph are expected. Decided to hold off on a high wind warning
for our far northwestern zones although gusts up to 60 mph are 
not completely out of the question for places like Harper Co. Wind
speeds will gradually decrease after sunset with decoupling but 
the gradient may result in advisory level winds lingering into 
the late evening across central and north central OK.

The aforementioned cloud cover and increasing surface dewpoints 
will keep temperatures cooler for most locations today. There's 
even a small chance some low level stratus could creep into 
southern/southeastern OK this morning. However, did not bite on 
the aggressive NAM12 solution for widespread stratus this morning 
along and east of I-35 since it usually has a moist bias in these 
scenarios.

Warm temperatures are expected again for most locations overnight
as breezy south winds continue, cloud cover increases, and sfc 
dewpoints remain in the upper 50s to low 60s. Across northwestern 
OK, however, the cold front will begin to surge southward and 
cooler/drier air will begin to filter in there. The first chance 
of rainfall will arrive around 09-12Z early Monday morning mainly 
across southwestern OK/western north TX and southeast OK as an 
initial subtle shortwave trough lifts out of north TX.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 332 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Shower and thunderstorm chances should rapidly increase after
sunrise Monday as a southern stream shortwave trough phases with
the upper trough and lifts northeastward, along with some of the 
remnants of hurricane Roslyn. All this as the cold front also
nears the I-44 corridor. Sufficient deep layer shear and just 
enough instability could support some organized updrafts near I-44
and eastward from early morning to early afternoon, with a threat
of small hail and damaging wind gusts (precip loading). In 
addition, brief, weak tornadoes can't be totally ruled out if some
low level instability (stretching) materializes within 25-30 kt 
of 0-1 km shear during the late morning hours across central and 
southern OK. A localized flooding threat will also exist along and
east of I-44 throughout Monday. Most of the first round of 
precipitation should exit to our east after 21Z as the cold front 
does the same.

The second round of precip should arrive late Monday afternoon 
across far western/southwestern OK and western north TX with the 
mid to upper low. This low is expected to track eastward 
along/near the Red River overnight into early Tuesday morning, 
with at least likely PoPs accompanying it over central and 
southern OK. Some strong to severe storms may be possible near the
Red River and north TX initially overnight Monday (mainly before 
midnight) depending on how much instability is present. The 
majority of the second round of precip will shift eastward out of
E/SE OK after 12Z Tuesday. Breezy north winds will follow the low
for the first half of Tuesday but currently do not anticipate 
advisory level speeds.

Much cooler conditions are expected behind this system. Zonal mid
to upper flow will be present over the central and western CONUS 
Wed. This will only be temporary, however, as another mid to upper
shortwave trough digs into the Rockies early Thursday AM. This 
feature is expected to near the panhandles late Thursday night 
into early Friday AM, perhaps closing as it nears north TX. 
Moisture will not be nearly as impressive with this system but 
enough mid to upper ascent will support another chance of mostly light
precipitation Friday into perhaps early Saturday. This will depend
on when/if it decides to close and its progression. Right now, 
the ECMWF and Canadian solutions linger it longer. Cooler temps 
will follow it into the weekend.

(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1242 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

VFR conditions will become MVFR overnight when moisture increases
and rain begins over much of the southern plains. Thunderstorms
are expected at times late in the period. A front will move from
northwest into central Oklahoma after midnight with gusty south
winds shifting to north.
