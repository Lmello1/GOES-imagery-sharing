.SHORT TERM...
(The rest of today )
Issued at 1117 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Very strong pressure gradient across the area this morning, as well
as mixing of strong wind flow above the ground, has resulted in 
35-45 mph gusts across much of nern OK and nwrn AR. Expect this to 
continue into this evening ahead of strong storm system translating 
into the Rockies today and associated pressure falls across the 
Plains. Wind Advisory continues for most of the area through 1am
Monday. Surface dewpoints have increased into the lower/mid 60s 
across the entire area as of 16z, which will keep minimum RHs this 
afternoon in the 35-50 percent range. This will help fire weather 
concerns some today, however, the very strong wind, drought-stricken
vegetation, and unseasonaby warm temperatures will all contribute to
near-critical fire spread rates today. Increased wind gust grids into
this evening, otherwise ongoing forecast is trending well.

.LONG TERM...
(Tonight through Saturday)
Issued at 306 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Strong and gusty winds will persist well into the evening as 
covered in the wind advisory. Continued transport of deep moisture
ahead of approaching trough along with wind will result in very
mild overnight lows again, with enough recovery in RH to help with
the fire situation. Frontal boundary will move close to northeast
OK by early Monday morning, with widespread rain forced along the
frontal zone, possibly as early as 06z across far northwest
sections, and over the remainder of eastern OK by a little after
12z. With the precip expanding and front moving into the area,
expect to see a very short thermometer Monday with much of 
eastern OK seeing falling temps. Forecast soundings showing deep 
moist layer with a tropical influence, supporting efficient rain 
production, and a much needed widespread rain event over the 
drought-plagued region. Expect a few embedded thunderstorms as 
well, which will enhance rain amounts in some areas.

Initial frontal band of rain will shift east into W AR Monday
afternoon and evening, with some lull in the precip during the
early part of Monday night. Main upper system still on track to
move across the area Tuesday morning, with rain and a few
thunderstorms expanding back across the area. The overall amounts
will be lighter with this round, but when all is said and done,
most of the forecast area should see 1-3 inches of rain with some
amounts to near 5 inches possible. 

A couple of dry days with pleasant cool fall temperatues will be 
followed by another potential system late in the week. Still quite
a bit of uncertainty with the timing/track of this system.

(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1236 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

MVFR CIG has developed into MLC at this time, but should be short-
lived. Otherwise, all sites expected to be VFR through 08z. Gusty 
southerly wind to 35 kts most sites into this evening. MVFR CIGS 
develop across much of the area late tonight and continue through the
end of the forecast period. Showers and scattered TSRA overspread 
the area from west to east after 08z, continuing through 18z with 
areas of IFR CIG VSBY probable.
