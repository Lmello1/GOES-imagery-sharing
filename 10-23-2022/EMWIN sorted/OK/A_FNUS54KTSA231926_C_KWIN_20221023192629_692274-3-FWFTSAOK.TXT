RED FLAG...NONE.

.DISCUSSION...
Strong and gusty south winds will continue to result in
problematic behavior in ongoing fires, or any others that may
start today. Higher relative humidity values will help mitigate
the threat somewhat, but gusty winds will continue well into the
overnight hours tonight ahead of an approaching storm system.
Widespread rain is expected to begin Monday morning and last into
Tuesday with much of the area forecast to receive beneficial
rainfall of 1-3 inches by Tuesday afternoon. Cooler and drier
weather will follow the storm system for the middle part of next
week.
