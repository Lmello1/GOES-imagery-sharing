	AREA...Eastern Oklahoma and Western Arkansas.
	ONSET...Ongoing.

DISCUSSION...
Strong and gusty southerly wind will continue into this evening with
gusts to around 45 mph expected across much of the area. Low level
moisture return will lead to higher humidities than those experienced
on previous days, which will reduce the fire spread potential some.
However, any ongoing fires or additional starts today could exhibit 
problematic behavior due to the strong wind, drought-stricken
vegetation, and unseasonably warm temperatures across the area.

The chance of thunderstorms across eastern Oklahoma will increase
after midnight with the approach of a storm system from the west. The
risk of severe weather is very low.

SPOTTER AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ACTION STATEMENT...
Spotter Activation Not Expected.

.DAYS TWO THROUGH SEVEN...Monday through Saturday.
MONDAY...Thunderstorm Potential...High Wind Potential...
Heavy Rain Potential.
TUESDAY...Thunderstorm Potential...High Wind Potential.
WEDNESDAY through SATURDAY...No Hazards.

EXTENDED DISCUSSION...
Widespread showers and scattered embedded thunderstorms will develop
across eastern Oklahoma Monday morning and spread eastward during 
the day. Despite ample moisture return across the area, instability
will be rather weak due to widespread cloudiness and precipitation. 
However, wind shear will be very strong, and combined with the weak 
instability, there could be some isolated strong to severe
thunderstorms capable of producing damaging wind gusts Monday through
Monday evening. There will also be periods of moderate to heavy 
rainfall. Occasional rain will continue into Tuesday, with most of 
the area seeing between one and three inches of rainfall by then. 
Local amounts of four to five inches will be possible, but the 
flooding threat remains low due to very dry soils.

Dry weather is forecast for Wednesday. Another storm system moving
through the area late this week will increase chances of showers 
Thursday night through Friday night.
