.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)
Issued at 410 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Today...A strong upper level trough over the western CONUS begins to 
shift into the Northern Plains today, while a surface trough deepens 
through western and central SD. Out ahead of these features, 
continuing warm air advection will result in near to record breaking 
temperatures for today, with ensembles still indicating 850 mb 
temperatures in the top 1 percent with respect to climatology. 850 
mb temperatures will soar into the mid teens to lower 20s C 
across the region, and highs will be more reminiscent of late 
summer - in the lower to mid 80s. In addition, it will be breezy 
day with a tightening surface gradient in response to the 
approaching trough from the west and increasing winds aloft. Model
averaged soundings are indicating winds around 40 kts at the top 
of the mixed layer, so we are looking at gusts of 35 to 40 mph - 
with a few higher gusts possible- through the afternoon.

This Evening into Tonight: Models are indicating the aforementioned 
surface trough/frontal boundary nudging into the western edges of 
our CWA around 00Z this evening, with CAMs indicating various 
degrees of convective development over our area toward 00Z - this in 
response to increasing mid level theta e advection as 850 mb winds 
really begin to ramp up, into the range of 50 to 70 kts by late 
evening. Model derived CAPE is not overly impressive during the 
evening - 500 to 1000 J/KG, though with the very strong winds aloft 
strong to severe convection will be possible. Soundings are 
indicating very dry air below 700 mb, lending support to strong 
winds mixing down to the surface with any storms that develop, with 
hail being a secondary threat. The main window for strong convection 
would be from about 6 pm to midnight, with the greater threat from 
the Interstate 29 corridor and eastward. Unfortunately, with the low 
level dry air, rainfall amounts will be on the low side with any 
storms that occur. Breezy to windy conditions will persist 
overnight, and with the potential to tap into the increasing winds 
aloft, have issued a Wind Advisory for our southeastern Iowa zones 
where gusts of 45 mph or greater will be possible from 00Z to 07Z. 
With cold air advection behind the front, temperatures will fall 
into the upper 30s to near 40 west of Interstate 29 overnight, to 
mid and upper 40s to the east.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 410 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Monday: The surface boundary pushes east of our area by Monday 
morning as a northern piece of energy ejects out of the upper level 
trough, traveling through the Northern Plains and into central 
Canada by the end of the day. It now appears that rainfall 
associated with that will remain to our west, while rainfall 
associated with the departing cold front will remain to our east - 
so bottom line is that it now looks to be mainly dry on Monday. It 
will be much cooler with strong cold air advection behind the front, 
and highs will only make it into the upper 40s to mid 50s as 850 mb 
temperatures fall to just either side of 0 C during the day. Breezy 
conditions will continue through the day with steep low level lapse 
rates and winds at the top of the mixed layer running around 25 to 
30 kts.

Tuesday through Saturday: Not much change to the previous forecast 
for the remainder of the week with near to below normal temperatures 
through the period. This will play out to highs in the 50s to lower 
60s and lows in the 20s and 30s. The only chance of rainfall remains 
in the Wednesday night to Thursday time frame as another upper level 
trough shifts out of the western CONUS. Any rainfall amounts will do 
little to alleviate the drought conditions with both GEFS and ECMWF 
ensembles indicating a 80 to 90 percent or greater of receiving less 
than half an inch during the period.

.AVIATION...(For the 18Z TAFS through 18Z Monday Afternoon)
Issued at 1235 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Mostly VFR conditions are expected through the TAF period. 
Currently, mostly clear conditions continue across the area with 
southerly to southeasterly winds. By this evening, winds are 
expected to strengthen with the development of a low level jet just 
west of I-29. Not only will this bring some low level wind shear to 
KFSD and KSUX from 00z to 06z, but also will increase overall winds 
speeds across the area with gusts between 30-40 kts possible.

Isolated showers and thunderstorms are expected to develop ahead of 
a cold front moving through the area this afternoon. As a result,
TSRA was added to KFSD around 00z. Along with the system, cloud 
coverage should begin to increase bringing more low level stratus
especially west of the James River. As a result, KHON and a few 
smaller airports in our western counties could be in MVFR flight 
conditions for a few hours tomorrow morning. Otherwise, winds 
will shift westerly after the front passes through this evening
with mostly westerly flow continuing through the rest of the TAF 
period.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 410 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Critical to near critical fire weather conditions will exist across 
the area today. Temperatures will be near or exceed records today - 
in the lower to mid 80s. These temperatures along with low level dry 
air will yield afternoon RH values of 20 to 40 percent. While these 
values are higher than Saturday, winds will be stronger today as 
atmospheric mixing taps into increasing winds aloft, and afternoon 
gusts will run in the range of 35 to 40 mph - with a few higher 
gusts possible. Because of that, extreme fire danger will exist 
generally along and south of Interstate 29, and a Red Flag Warning 
remains in effect for these areas for this afternoon and evening. 

Much cooler temperatures move into the area on Monday, and although 
afternoon RH values will be higher - in the range of 35 to 50 
percent, northwesterly winds will be gusting 25 to 35 mph. For that 
reason, an elevated fire danger will remain.
