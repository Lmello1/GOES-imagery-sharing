.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 150 PM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Colder air will continue to move in behind a cold front this
evening while a band of rain and high mountain snow over portions
of northern New Mexico continues to weaken. The rain and high 
mountain snow shift south of I-40 after midnight. Freezing 
temperatures are forecast for many areas Monday night. Quieter 
weather returns Tuesday and Wednesday with more chances for low 
elevation rain and mountain snow Thursday.

.SHORT TERM...
(This evening through Monday night)
Issued at 150 PM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022

A complex scenario is in play for the short term as a deep upper low 
pushes east into the northern Rockies, while a cutoff low migrates 
through the Baja. Meanwhile, the polar jet is anticipated to 
strengthen as the system continues its swing through the Rockies 
overnight. Current windy conditions will taper off into the early 
evening -- the one exception being across the south central mts 
where 50 kt flow at 700 mb will persist and allow the blustery sfc 
winds to continue until the early morning hours. As such, did elect 
to extend the High Wind Warning for the south central mts until 
24/09Z.

Current water vapor imagery shows faint moisture along the 
eastern periphery of the subtropical low being wafted into the 
southern portion of the state, while forcing is enhanced by the 
approaching polar low. Rain will dominate early in evening and 
into tonight below 9500 ft until after 9Z when temperatures fall 
enough to support more widespread wintery mix and snow across the 
central mts and westward. The polar jet dips further south Monday 
morning, allowing a second piece of energy to break off from the 
parent system. This will help to focus additional precip across 
the southern portion of the CWA, with the highest amounts favoring
the south central mts. Daytime highs will be greatly reduced from
Sunday's readings, with many locals seeing a 10 to 25 degree 
departure. As the low pushes east, a weak trowal feature may work 
to enhance precip on late Monday afternoon into the evening across
the northeast. Invigoration of cold air and clearing will lead to
widespread freezing temperatures on Monday night, with the 
exception being across the southeast where overnight lows will 
hover just above freezing.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Saturday)
Issued at 150 PM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Northwest flow aloft Tuesday morning is forecast to transition to
zonal flow by Tuesday afternoon. The flow aloft backs in response
to another relatively deep upper-level trough over the Inland NW.
This trough drops southeastward through the eastern Great Basin
Wednesday night. GFS keeps the trough a progressive open wave as 
it slides southeast through NM Thursday while at the same time, 
the ECWMF closes the feature off over southeast UT Thursday 
morning. The closed circulation results in much better surface 
convergence over NM and much more in the way of low elevation rain
and mountain snow. ECMWF is the favored solution/forecast given 
persistence (current trough/closed low) and the fact that its 
operational run is very similar to its 51 member ensemble mean. 
Snow levels will be above about 7,500 feet on average Thursday, 
lowering over the western half of the state during the afternoon. 
ECMWF keeps the low over NM through Thursday night before it heads
east into TX late- day Friday. More tranquil is forecast for next
weekend. High temperatures remain below seasonal averages for 
late October.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1147 AM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Strong wly and swly winds will persist through the aftn and into
the early evening. The strongest winds will be across the central
mts and ewd where gusts of 45 to 55 kts can be expected. Winter 
weather will also impact the northern mts with IFR conditions 
possible. Shwrs and isold thunder will stretch across west central
to north central areas as the front makes its arrival this aftn, 
increasing in coverage and continuing into the overnight hours.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 150 PM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022

No critical fire weather conditions expected over the next 7 days. 
Unsettled weather will continue today into Monday as an upper level 
storm system traverses the Rockies. High winds seen this afternoon 
will taper off into the evening hours with the exception of the 
south central mountains where windy conditions will persist 
overnight. Cooler temperatures will take hold Monday with the 
passage of the frontal system. Drier weather is expected Tuesday and 
Wednesday before another system brings wind and precipitation on 
Thursday.
