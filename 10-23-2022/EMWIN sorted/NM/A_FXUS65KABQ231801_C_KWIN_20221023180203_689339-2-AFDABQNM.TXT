.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 217 AM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022
A couple of storm systems will bring wind, rain and snow
accumulation, and much colder temperatures during the coming week.
The first storm will be the strongest with the potential for a few
to around 4 inches of snow accumulation above 7500 feet today 
through Monday, except up to 9 inches in the mountains near the 
Colorado border. Light snow is also expected in many lower 
elevation locations late tonight into early Monday morning. West 
and southwest winds will become strong today with gusts to from 40
to 50 mph common, except for gusts to 60 mph along the central 
mountain chain and across northeast and east central areas. In the
wake of the first storm system a widespread hard freeze looks 
likely over northern, western and central areas Monday night, with
near freezing temperatures across southeast areas, the upper 
Tularosa Valley, and the Albuquerque heights. After a break in the
weather Tuesday and Wednesday, winds look to strengthen again 
with the second storm system Thursday and Thursday night. 
Widespread light rain and snow showers are again expected, with a 
few inches of snow possible in the northern and central mountains.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 217 AM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022

A challenging short term forecast is in order with wind and winter 
highlights dominating much of this morningâ€™s decision making. Water 
vapor satellite imagery indicates a very cold core low over Idaho 
while the cut-off low west of the Baja peninsula is getting sheared 
with signs of being drawn northeastward. Earlier around 23/0000UTC, 
the polar jet was very strong (150 kt at 300 mb) on the west side of 
the ID low, allowing it to dive south some, but a more recent 
weakening in the jet will likely cause it to slow its southward 
movement. The subtropical jet is also strengthening ahead of the 
Baja low and into NM, and as that subtropical low lifts inland 
toward NM today as a trough, a merging of the subtropical and polar 
jet will occur over the Land of Enchantment. A broad and deep 
surface cyclone will couple with these upper level features with 
minimum surface pressure expected to drop toward approximately 983 
mb in the central plains with a stiff surface gradient lagging into 
NM. With deep diurnal mixing expected, this will set the stage for a 
very windy day with the most severe gusts still anticipated along 
the central mountain chain of NM into the northeastern quadrant of 
the state. Several Wind Advisories will be surrounding the High Wind 
Watch today.

As for precipitation, spotty to scattered showers and thunderstorms 
are already developing in the large scale ascent preceding the 
approaching low, and increased low to mid level moisture via the 
subtropical jet is assisting this effort. Much of this activity is 
expected to begin dwindling and waning east of the central mountain 
chain during the late morning as downsloping winds become too 
overpowering. This will direct the focus for precipitation near 
frontogenetical forcing that will enter northwestern NM as the polar 
low sags into WY. Rain will be common during the daytime in much of 
this area, except in the northern mountains where more snow will be 
found, particularly above 9,500 feet and the Winter Weather Advisory 
will remain intact to account for this with a couple to a few inches 
of accumulation beginning today. Instability will be faint and 
decreasing through the afternoon, but a few thunderstorms will still 
be possible in west central to north central zones.

The polar jet on the backside of the ID/WY low is modeled to 
strengthen by the early evening, and this will be the catalyst that 
allows another vort lobe and additional pressure falls to begin 
diving southward again tonight while the initial low ejects into the 
northern Great Plains. The secondary vort lobe will swing close to 
the Four Corners area tonight before the low closes off and deepens 
over eastern NM Monday afternoon. This will likely lead to a brief 
disruption in the southwest-northeast oriented precipitation band in 
the very late afternoon and early evening before it redevelops 
farther south later tonight. This newly reinvigorated 
frontogenetical precipitation band could lead to higher 
precipitation totals for the southern tier of counties/zones, 
including a few inches of snow atop Sierra Blanca, and a trowal 
feature may also briefly enhance wrap-around precipitation on 
Monday. Cold air advection will also continue tonight into early 
Monday with daytime highs expected to run 15 to 20 degrees below 
normal for late October. Northerly winds will also be stiff on 
Monday with areas on the backside of the low observing strong 
northwesterly flow that could warrant additional wind advisories.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday night through Saturday)
Issued at 217 AM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Monday night, in the wake of the exiting storm system, a 
widespread hard freeze is expected, except for near freezing
temperatures across southeast areas, in the upper Tularosa Valley,
and across the Northeast and Southeast Heights of Albuquerque. In
recent runs, models weakened the flow aloft significantly for 
Monday night compared to previous runs, so surface winds should 
die off more quickly than previously expected enabling temperature
inversions to develop and protect some mid-slope regions from 
freezing (like the Albuquerque heights).

Dry weather is expected Tuesday and Wednesday, and temperatures 
are forecast to rebound as the flow over NM becomes more zonal. 
Highs still look to peak Wednesday a few to around 7 degrees 
below normal. Winds will become gusty Wednesday as the flow aloft
strengthens ahead of a new upper level trough digging over the 
northwest US. 

The operational run of the Canadian Model has now joined the GFS 
and ECMWF Models in depicting the upper level trough forming a 
closed upper level low pressure system as it tracks southeastward 
over the forecast area Thursday afternoon and night. The latest 
forecast track from Farmington, to Albuquerque, to Roswell, is 
farther west and south than previously forecast, which will reduce
the wind threat some by shifting the track of the polar jet 
stream further south and west. As a result 50 mph wind gusts 
should be relegated to west central, southwest and south central 
parts of the forecast area on Thursday afternoon, and gusts to 60 
mph look unlikely. The new forecast track should also result in 
more widespread rain and snow showers Thursday and Thursday night;
however, a lack of rich moisture and fairly fast movement of the 
upper low should keep accumulations light. The northern and 
central mountains may be able to squeeze out a few inches of snow,
and perhaps a little more over the high peaks of the Sangre de 
Cristos. A sharp wind shift and potentially strong wind gusts are
expected with Pacific and backdoor cold fronts on Thursday, which
are expected to cause high temperatures to plummet around 5 to 10
degrees below Wednesday's readings over northern, western and 
central areas. In the wake of the exiting storm system, gusty cold
air advection looks to continue across the eastern plains Friday,
as temperatures fall a few to around 8 additional degrees. A 
temperature rebound that begins in the west Friday, will continue 
areawide under zonal flow aloft Saturday, but highs should remain 
a few to around 9 degrees below normal.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1147 AM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Strong wly and swly winds will persist through the aftn and into
the early evening. The strongest winds will be across the central
mts and ewd where gusts of 45 to 55 kts can be expected. Winter 
weather will also impact the northern mts with IFR conditions 
possible. Shwrs and isold thunder will stretch across west central
to north central areas as the front makes its arrival this aftn, 
increasing in coverage and continuing into the overnight hours.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 217 AM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Deteriorating weather conditions are expected to continue today into 
Monday. For today, winds will continue to strengthen through the 
morning with the central mountain chain and the northeastern 
quadrant of NM still appearing to host the strongest gusts of 50 to 
65 mph. Cooling temperatures and slightly higher humidity in this 
area will preclude any critical fire weather risk. Rain and high 
elevation snow showers will increase today over west central to 
north central NM along with some thunderstorms. Brisk conditions are 
forecast into tonight and Monday as cooler air keeps spilling into 
the state while precipitation slowly shifts southward and eastward. 
Breezy to windy conditions will still be present on Monday, but the 
wind direction will have shifted northwesterly. A chilly night is 
still expected Monday night with a widespread freeze forecast, and 
this could initiate a faster curing of wildland fuels through the 
remainder of the fall season. For the rest of the work week, 
temperatures will remain below seasonal averages with another 
reinforcement of cooler air and breezy to windy conditions still set 
to arrive on Thursday.
