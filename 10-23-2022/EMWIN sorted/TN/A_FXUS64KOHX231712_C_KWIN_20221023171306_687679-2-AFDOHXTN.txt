.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 130 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

It was a mild late night / early morning across Middle Tennessee 
with temperatures mostly in the mid to upper 50s. For today, we 
can expect warm temps in the 70s to around 80. There will be more 
sunshine than we had yesterday as a building upper level ridge 
pushes the thicker high clouds out of the area. Humidity levels 
had crept up a little yesterday, but drier air associated with 
the east coast surface ridge will push back into the area today,
lowering afternoon RH values near 30 percent. This lower humidity,
along with a few wind gusts to 15mph, will enhance the on-going 
drought related fire danger. Mild to warm temps and dry wx will 
continue through Monday.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday Night through next Sunday)
Issued at 130 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Monday night into Tuesday will be quite mild and breezy as a
system approaches from the west. The compact low pressure system 
and cold front will sweep across the area Tuesday and Tuesday 
night with showers and a few rumbles of thunder. Instability seems
unimpressive, but the system is quite dynamic, so future 
forecasts may include some strong storm potential. Even without
storms, winds will kick up with gusts over 30mph. Some local 
downpours are expected Tuesday afternoon and evening, but the fast
moving system will not have much time to make a big dent in the 
drought. The latest qpf shows many areas receiving one half to 1 
inch of rain, with more than 1 inch in our western counties. This 
seems optimistic given the speed of the system, but I think we are
all hopeful for soaking rain.

Temperatures will drop to near normal behind the system. Dry 
weather is expected Wednesday and Thursday, then shower chances 
start to creep up for the weekend.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1208 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022
TAF's are VFR. High pressure remains the dominant weather feature
at the surface and aloft. So we can expect mostly sunny skies
again today with gusty southerly winds. Winds will decouple after
sunset and pick back up again tomorrow afternoon.
