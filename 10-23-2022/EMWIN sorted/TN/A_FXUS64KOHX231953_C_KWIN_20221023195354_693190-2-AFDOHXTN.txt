.SHORT TERM...
(This afternoon through Monday Night)
Issued at 203 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Breezy south winds and mild temperatures have made for another
great day across the mid state. Warmer than normal temperatures
will continue tonight and tomorrow. Expect lows Monday morning to
be close to what we saw this morning...in the low to mid 40s on
the Plateau and in the 50s elsewhere. Mid level ridging will peak
over our area tomorrow, which will make for another dry and warm 
day...with lower RH values than today, so fire weather concerns 
will remained heightened at least through the day tomorrow. 
Temperatures are forecast to be in the upper 70s, but with winds 
picking up from the west tomorrow afternoon we could see 
temperatures over perform as we mix out. Winds will continue to be
breezy into Monday night.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through next Sunday)
Issued at 203 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

An approaching low pressure system and associated cold front will
push east on Tuesday providing increasing cloud cover, gusty
winds in the morning and then showers and storms Tuesday 
afternoon and evening. Instability remains very limited with this 
system, but shear and low level helicity look conducive to 
producing strong wind gusts with any convection that develops. The
best timing for storm potential will likely be in a small window
between 3PM and midnight, but models haven't come into agreement
on a more specific window yet. We're holding out hope that there 
will be several places that see more than a half inch of rain 
Tuesday, but precip looks to move through fairly quickly, which 
may keep totals a little lower. There could be some stray showers
that wrap around the low on Wednesday morning, but for the most
part we'll be dry Wednesday through Friday evening. Temperatures
will briefly dip closer to normal on Wednesday after the frontal
passage and as the upper low moves off to our northeast, but we
should rebound into the 70s as we head into the weekend...where
our next chance of rain awaits.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1208 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022
TAF's are VFR. High pressure remains the dominant weather feature
at the surface and aloft. So we can expect mostly sunny skies
again today with gusty southerly winds. Winds will decouple after
sunset and pick back up again tomorrow afternoon.
