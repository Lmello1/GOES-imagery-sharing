Fire Weather Planning Forecast
National Weather Service Paducah KY
328 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

.DISCUSSION...
Expect elevated fire danger in the near term, with dry fuels,
robust daytime surface winds, and moderately low afternoon
humidity minimums through Monday.

Southwesterly low level flow will continue into early this week 
as a low pressure system approaches the Heartland out of Texas. 
This system will pass over our area on Tuesday, generating wetting
rain as early as Monday night west of the Mississippi River. 
Wetting rain is almost a sure thing on Tuesday before tapering off
Tuesday night. High surface pressure behind the system will mean 
mild temperatures and moderate afternoon humidity minimums for 
much of the week. Another low pressure system is forecast to
approach the Heartland by next weekend, possibly generating
another chance of rain.
