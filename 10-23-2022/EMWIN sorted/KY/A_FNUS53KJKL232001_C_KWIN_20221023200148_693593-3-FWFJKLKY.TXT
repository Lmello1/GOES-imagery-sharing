...Low RH on Monday and Tuesday Afternoons...
...Gusty Southerly Breeze on Tuesday...

.DISCUSSION...Southerly flow will continue the dry conditions and
above normal temperatures over eastern Kentucky through Tuesday
afternoon, as high pressure remains anchored to our east. 
Relative humidity values drop between 25 and 35 percent each 
afternoon through Tuesday. Winds will stay below 10 mph on Monday,
though a few gusts up to 15 mph are possible. Winds will be 
stronger on Tuesday with southerly gusts of 15 to 25 mph 
anticipated. High rain chances arrive for Tuesday night; but, 
while all of the area should see at least a little rain, overall 
rainfall amounts appear meager, ranging from a few hundreths to 
perhaps 3 or 4 tenths of an inch.
