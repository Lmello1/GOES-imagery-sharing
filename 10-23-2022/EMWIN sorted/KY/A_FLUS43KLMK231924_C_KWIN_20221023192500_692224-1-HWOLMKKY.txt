This hazardous weather outlook is for portions of south central
Indiana and Central Kentucky.

.DAY ONE...Tonight.

No hazardous weather is expected at this time.

.DAYS TWO THROUGH SEVEN...Monday through Saturday.

Prolonged dry weather, along with low relative humidity and moderate
southerly winds, will cause an increased fire danger Monday 
afternoon. Any fire that starts could become difficult to control. 
Obey all local burn bans, and consider postponing any outdoor burning
until conditions improve.

Tuesday late afternoon through early Wednesday morning rain chances 
will increase. A low pressure system will move quickly across the 
center of the country and take advantage of tropical moisture moving 
into our region. This system could bring good soaking rains, 
especially to areas along and west of the I-65 corridor, along with a
slight chance for thunderstorms. The main threats with these storms 
will be heavy rain and brief gusty winds.

.SPOTTER INFORMATION STATEMENT...

Spotter activation is not anticipated at this time.
