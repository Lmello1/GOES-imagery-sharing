.SYNOPSIS....
A stronger system will move in from the northwest overnight 
delivering widespread precipitation and breezy winds for Monday. 
Much of this precipitation will fall as snow over the mountains 
and most passes. Another system moves in late Tuesday into 
Wednesday. Temperatures will remain below normal with the active 
fall weather pattern persisting through the end of the week.

.DISCUSSION...

...Series of Fall storms to bring rounds of precipitation this
week...

Tonight: Looking to the west on satellite we can see our approaching 
upper level weather system. Locally, we've seen some increasing 
cloud cover this afternoon across eastern Washington while the 
Cascade Crest and adjacent valleys are still seeing mostly clear 
skies -- all that changes tonight. Temperatures today have been 
pretty consistent with the previous day, however we're still a 
handful of degrees below seasonal normal. The story this week will 
be a series of storms bringing several rounds of precipitation to 
the region, both in the form of lowland rainfall and mountain snow.

Monday: A weak atmospheric river will drive the moisture into 
western Washington and then shift south into Oregon and Idaho by 
late Monday. The onset of precipitation will begin overnight into 
the early hours Monday across the Cascade mountains. High-res models 
bring the heaviest precipitation from near Mount Rainier north to 
the Canadian border, providing for sufficient orographic lift and 
dynamic instability. Some weak cold air advection will filter in 
from the south aiding in better snow production through the column. 
The Cascade mountain passes should fair well with snowfall into 
early Monday. The HREF even has some spots of 70-80% probability of 
greater than 1"/hour accumulations, more for the North Cascade Pass 
than Stevens. The NBM has increased probs for snow amounts through 
Monday morning as well, but road temperatures still look marginal 
for accumulations. Since we are seeing a much colder airmass (and 
even more so later this week) than we saw late last week, it's only 
a matter of time before we start to see more road accumulations and 
not just on the grassy shoulders. All said and done, the Cascade
Mountain Passes should see 4 to 8 inches of snow with Sherman Pass
measuring close to 3 inches and Lookout Pass around 3 to 5 inches
as well.

Elsewhere, lower elevations can expect rain. However, given the fair 
drop in snow levels (near 3000 feet by late afternoon), wouldn't be 
surprised if we see some rain/snow mix from Sandpoint to Deer Park 
to Pullman, though no accumulations. The fast moving storm will 
boast some breezy to gusty west to southwest winds. This will 
play a part in our Cascade-Rain-Shadow effect for parts of the 
western Columbia Basin. However, the Idaho Panhandle mountains 
should do well with an unstable west flow. Winds will increase
during the late morning hours bringing gusts of 30 to 35 mph
commonly across the Columbia Basin, Palouse, Spokane-Coeur d'Alene
areas. 

Tuesday: More of a transitional day between weather systems, a
break in the precipitation and break in the clouds should come
Tuesday. After a round of precipitation and a cold airmass in
place, morning stratus and fog will be likely in low lying areas.
/Dewey

Wednesday through Sunday: Low pressure will push through the 
Inland Northwest on Wednesday, causing rain and mountain snow. The 
bulk of the precip should impact the Cascades and northern ID 
panhandle, with other areas receiving less. Snow levels are forecast 
to remain generally between 3000-4000 ft. Road surface temps should 
be cold enough for snow to impact travel across the passes. Model 
trends are leaning drier for Wednesday night and Thursday. 

Forecast remains unsettled for Friday and beyond, and though run-to-
run model consensus/consistency is lacking a bit at this stage, we 
continue with decent chances for rain and mountain snow each day. 

Occasionally breezy winds through the period, especially afternoons 
across the Columbia Basin. Not a lot of day to day variability in 
temps across the region for the extended forecast...highs in the 
upper 40s to mid 50s across most population centers, highs in the 
30s across the mountains. /KD

.AVIATION... 
18Z TAFs: Early morning stratus has slowly eroded away to VFR
ceilings for COE-SFF-GEG-PUW. Still some low-mid clouds, but
largely should be a more clear and dry day across the Inland
Northwest. Changes will begin tonight ahead of a moist weather
system, which will deliver widespread lowering clouds and
rain/snow mix for some sites. The north Cascades will see snow
while elsewhere below 3500 ft AGL should see rain/snow mix with
little to no accumulation expected and MVFR conditions. /Dewey
