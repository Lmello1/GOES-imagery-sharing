Area Forecast Discussion

.SYNOPSIS....
An weakening upper level trough will exit the Inland Northwest
today delivering a drying trend to the area. The break will be
brief as a stronger system moves in from the northwest overnight
delivering widespread precipitation and breezy winds. Much of this
precipitation will fall as snow over the mountains and most
passes. Another system moves in late Tuesday into Wednesday. 
Temperatures will remain below normal with the active fall weather
pattern persisting through the end of the week.

.DISCUSSION...

...UPDATED TO ISSUE A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY FOR SNOW FOR THE
HIGHWAY 20 CORRIDOR WEST OF MAZAMA LATE TONIGHT THROUGH EARLY
TUESDAY...

Today...Today will be a day of transition as the 
unstable deep upper level trough spinning over the Idaho 
Panhandle drifts east and is replaced by drier and more stable 
northwest flow. This will result in drying trend as any of the 
precipitation associated with the trough will gradually exit the 
area by midday. Current radar data is detecting very light 
precipitation returns over extreme NE Washington and the ID 
Panhandle and this will likely continue through the early morning 
hours. The greatest threat of seeing measurable precipitation this
morning will occur over Shoshone County, but amounts should be 
quite light. Skies will begin the day filled with sunshine for 
most of central Washington, with a decreasing cloud trend 
elsewhere. However the sunshine will wane through the afternoon as
the next weather system nears the area from the northwest. 

...Weak atmospheric river to bring areas of moderate precipitation
and breezy conditions late tonight through Monday...

Tonight through Monday night...The next system will be swift 
mover with warm air advection precipitation beginning near the 
Cascades after midnight then gradually spreading eastward 
overnight. By daybreak the precipitation will be well established 
near the Cascade Crest as well as over the eastern third of 
Washington and the Idaho Panhandle. Meanwhile in central 
Washington, the precipitation threat will be significantly less 
and quite brief as the mid-level warm advection is replaced by 
strong cold air advection by mid-morning. Its conceivable that 
locations from the Okanogan Valley to the lower Columbia Basin see
only a few hundredths of precipitation before all is said and 
done. While the story over central Washington will be of light 
precipitation, that won’t be the case elsewhere due to a glancing 
blow by a weak atmospheric river. Precipitable water values will 
near 0.75” by daybreak which is approximately 150% of normal. This
plume will then drift slowly southward through the day moving 
into the southern half of Oregon and Idaho by late afternoon. This
will likely result in some appreciable precipitation amounts near
the Cascade Crest and over the Idaho Panhandle. The heaviest 
amounts will occur near the immediate crest with up to one inch of
precipitation. Values over the Idaho Panhandle will range from 
0.30-0.70” with locally up to an inch over the mountains near the 
MT border. 

The precipitation type over most valleys will be rain, or a 
rain snow mix, but accumulations are not expected. The exception 
will be in the valleys near the Cascades and the Canadian Border 
where less than an inch is expected. The story will be a little 
different over the mountains where light to moderate accumulations
are expected. Snow levels will generally drop to 2000-3000 feet 
overnight and will rise to 3500-4000 feet by afternoon. So for 
locations above these elevations we expect to see mainly snow. 
This will impact Stevens, Lookout, Washington, and Sherman Pass. 
The heaviest will occur at Washington Pass where 5-9 inches looks 
possible. For Stevens and Lookout Passes snowfall amounts will 
range from 3-7 inches. Sherman Pass will see a relatively meager 
1-2 inches. The question is how readily will this snow be able to 
accumulate. That is a tough question. For the Cascades, at least 
the snow will begin during the nighttime hours, giving a chance to
cool the roads and accumulate. For Lookout Pass the precipitation
likely won’t really pick up until after sunrise. We may need to 
issue some early season winter highlights to raise the awareness. 
The threat of precipitation will slowly ease overnight as drier 
air moves in from the north. 

The other concern for this upcoming storm will be the threat of 
windy conditions. 850 mb winds still look like they will peak in 
the 30-35 knot range tomorrow morning. The question is how 
effectively will these be able to mix down to the ground. Our hi-
res models aren’t depicting this as a terribly windy event with 
peak speeds ranging from 30-35 mph, however there will be locally 
stronger winds over the Waterville Plateau, Blue Mountains and 
Mission Ridge. Based on model soundings, there really isn’t much 
chance of seeing mountain wave winds developing so wind highlights
are not expected at this time. The winds will taper off gradually
overnight. fx

Unsettled and Active Week Ahead.

Tuesday through Sunday: A series of troughs will push through the 
region bringing mountain snow and low lying rainshowers. The zonal 
flow with the waves will cause the Cascades and Idaho Panhandle to 
receive the brunt of the precip while the area between will receive 
less. Temperatures for the period will be consistent. Highs will be 
in the low 50s and 40s. Mountain areas highs will remain in the 
30s. Lows will be in the mid 30s and 20s. 

The stronger trough will move through the region Tuesday and 
Wednesday. QPF estimates are carrying 1-1.5" for the Cascades and 
0.5-0.75" for the Idaho Panhandle. The rest of the region is showing 
up to a quarter of an inch. Snow levels will be 3000 feet overnight 
and 4000 feet during the day. It is expected to be a decent snow 
producer for the Cascade Crests and Lookout Pass areas. Snow ratios 
in those areas are 8:1 up to 9:1. Ensembles snow amounts for the 
showing the Cascades receiving 6-12" and the Lookout Pass area 
with 5-10". Sherman Pass could reach 3". Timing of snow is 
expected to impact accumulation as air temps will be just above 
freezing. Road surface temps should be cool enough for snow to 
potentially impact travel in these areas. 

By Thursday morning, the trough has exited the region and shower 
activity will diminish across the region by midday. Models begin to 
diverge for Friday and the weekend on the timing of the next system. 
For now, a quick moving shortwave will pass early Friday bringing 
snow showers to the Idaho Panhandle. Another strong trough will move 
through the region over the weekend bringing another round of 
widespread showers with mountain snow and rain showers for lower 
elevations. Winds will be breezy with the trough passages with gusts 
into the 20s expected. /JDC

.AVIATION... 
18Z TAFs: Early morning stratus has slowly eroded away to VFR
ceilings for COE-SFF-GEG-PUW. Still some low-mid clouds, but
largely should be a more clear and dry day across the Inland
Northwest. Changes will begin tonight ahead of a moist weather
system, which will deliver widespread lowering clouds and
rain/snow mix for some sites. The north Cascades will see snow
while elsewhere below 3500 ft AGL should see rain/snow mix with
little to no accumulation expected and MVFR conditions. /Dewey
