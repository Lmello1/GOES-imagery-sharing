.SHORT TERM...
(Tonight through Monday night)
Issued at 233 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

We are currently observing strong gusty southeasterly winds over 
southeast Rio Grande Valley. Currently there is a Wind Advisory 
out for Kenedy, Willacy, Cameron, and Southern Hidalgo counties. 
Rip Current Statement has also been extend through Monday night, 
but will likely need to be extended further. 

Tonight, winds are expected to weaken allowing for the Wind 
Advisory to expire. Most of Deep South Texas and Rio Grande Valley
will be partly to mostly cloudy as moisture from Tropical Storm 
Roslyn moves into the area. Isolated showers are possible in 
Zapata and Starr counties. Low temperatures will drop into the 
70's. 

Monday is expected to be similar to today with high winds during 
the afternoon with partly cloudy skies. Another Wind Advisory may 
be needed for portions of the CWA. High temperatures will reach in
the 90's in most spots.

Monday night, a cold front will move through Deep South Texas and
Rio Grande Valley. The Storm Prediction Center has placed all of 
Deep South Texas and Rio Grande Valley into a marginal risk for 
severe thunderstorms. Biggest concern is damaging wind gusts up to
60 mph, however there is a slight chance of small hail as well. 
Isolated showers and thunderstorms will start the evening then 
probabilities increase as the evening progresses and the cold 
front moves through the area. Low temperatures will be in 60's.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through next Sunday)
Issued at 233 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Say hello to a strong cold front knocking at the northern gates 
midnight Monday and pushing through and offshore by dawn Tuesday. 
A marginal risk of severe weather is in place through Tuesday 
morning, but there is no risk on Tuesday as the front pushes 
offshore. Still, kept thunder in for the Lower Valley on Tuesday 
morning. Rain chances will alos turn off quickly from west to east
on Tuesday as cooler, drier air filters in and stabilizes the 
atmosphere. Speaking of drier air, see the fire weather paragraph 
below. Breezy north winds, especially near the coast, will develop
in the wake of the front on Tuesday.

Otherwise, a nearly zonal 500 mb flow will prevail Tuesday night 
through Friday with generally rain-free conditions through 
Wednesday night. Rain chances will return Thursday into Thursday 
night, mainly near the coast, as Gulf moisture makes a come back.
Another mid- level trough axis will swing east over the Plains 
and will drag a weak cold front into the region on Friday. 
Isolated to scattered showers and thunderstorms will be possible 
on Friday with the front. 

Slightly cooler weather will prevail on Tuesday and Wednesday 
before temperatures trend up late in the week with south flow. 
Daytime high temps in the lower to mid 80s and overnight lows in 
the 60s will occur Tuesday through Friday. Temperatures will fall 
back to near to slightly below normal by the weekend in the wake 
of the next front.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1233 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

VFR conditions will persist through the TAF period. Winds will be
southeasterly and will continue to be windy during the period.
Wind gusts could get up to 30 to 35 kts through the rest of the
afternoon and again on Monday afternoon. 

&&

.MARINE...
Issued at 233 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Tonight through Monday Night...Marine conditions will be rough as
Small Craft Advisory remains in effect until 18z/1 PM CDT 
Tuesday. Winds will stay elevated throughout the period before and
after the cold front moves through the area late Monday night or 
early Tuesday morning. Isolated showers and thunderstorms are 
possible Monday evening and then increase as the cold front moves 
through the area.

Tuesday through Friday Night...A cold front will surge over the 
waters Tuesday morning, resulting in a shift to strong north winds
and building seas. Small craft advisory conditions will be a 
given, and a few gusts to gale force will be possible in the 
immediate aftermath of the front mid to late Tuesday morning. 
Conditions will start to improve by Tuesday afternoon, however, as
high pressure quickly spreads over the area. Nonetheless, small 
craft advisory conditions may persist on the Gulf through Tuesday 
afternoon or evening.

The story is not finished, however. Moderate southeast winds will
start to increase (to 15 to 20 knots) on Thursday ahead of 
another cold front. Small craft should exercise caution conditions
(or even marginal small craft advisory conditions) will develop 
on Thursday afternoon, moreso on the Gulf, before winds shift to 
moderate north Friday night.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 233 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Relative humidity values behind the front will plunge into the 
20s anywhere significantly west of the coast Tuesday afternoon. 
However, winds at 20 feet will be trending down and may not be as 
high as 15 mph anywhere Tuesday afternoon. Furthermore, fuels are 
not cured though there is some drying. While there could be some 
rain, amounts will be limited with the quick frontal passage. All
said, the ingredients currently do not convincingly add up to any
fire weather products.
