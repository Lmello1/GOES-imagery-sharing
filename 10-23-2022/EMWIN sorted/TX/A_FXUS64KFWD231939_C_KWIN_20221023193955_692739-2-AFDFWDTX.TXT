/Through Sunrise Tuesday/

Bottom Line: Monday's early morning rain will give way to 
scattered thunderstorm activity through the afternoon. There will 
be a threat for strong to severe storms mainly across Central
Texas, with damaging winds the primary concern. Hail and a few 
tornadoes cannot be ruled out. Heavy rain may also lead to
isolated flooding if training of thunderstorms occurs. 

A potent series of shortwaves is inching closer to North and 
Central Texas as a powerful trough digs southeastward across the 
Four Corners region. The first shortwave that will impact the 
region will be the remnants of Tropical Storm Roslyn, currently 
bringing torrential rainfall to the mountainous terrain of central
Mexico. Forcing for ascent and moisture will gradually increase 
after midnight, leading to the development of isolated to 
scattered rain showers through sunrise Monday. As the remnants of 
Roslyn skirt our region, another shortwave will arrive from the 
west, ushering much stronger forcing for ascent. Thunderstorm 
activity should blossom just west of our region by mid-morning, 
forming a cluster of convection as it marches eastward through the
early afternoon hours. Slight linear organization cannot be ruled
out with a threat for strong winds. Slightly more isolated 
convection may develop across Central Texas, where instability is 
likely to be slightly higher. This area will need to be monitored 
for any overzealous rotating updrafts capable of hail and damaging
winds. In addition to the convective threats, there is a chance 
that thunderstorm training leads to isolated flash flooding across
eastern portions of North and Central Texas. Remain vigilant if 
heavy rain affects your vicinity over an extended period of time.

The next source of strong lift will be the incoming front 
expected to arrive around sunset across our western counties, 
then progress eastward through the night. Given a fairly worked-
over atmosphere, it becomes difficult to predict just how much 
recovery will take place in the wake of the afternoon convection 
and the arrival of the front. With guidance suggesting slightly 
more scarce convection across Central Texas earlier in the day, 
probability of strong to severe storms will remain highest in that
area although it cannot be discounted further north into eastern 
North Texas. Storms along the cold front will pose mainly a strong
to damaging wind threat. Given the presence of appreciable 0-3km 
shear orthogonal/nearly orthogonal to the expected linear complex,
a quick QLCS tornado or two cannot be ruled out during the 
evening hours tomorrow. 

Breezy westerly winds will follow behind the front, continuing 
through the night. As the main upper level low moves overhead, 
wrap around moisture may be sufficient for additional showers and 
isolated storms to continue along the Red River through sunrise 
Tuesday. We'll have to monitor the threat for small hail with any 
early morning convection on Tuesday given lapse rates may approach
7.5 C/km along the Red River.

.LONG TERM... /NEW/
/Tuesday Through Next Weekend/

As a stout upper low moves along the Red River Tuesday on it's 
march eastward, lingering rain chances will remain over our 
northeastern counties Tuesday morning. Rain chances will end by 
midday and clear skies will prevail behind the cold front. The 
pendant cold front will have pushed through our entire forecast 
area by early Tuesday, and a tight pressure gradient will bring 
gusty north winds to North and Central Texas. Below normal 
temperatures will be in play for Tuesday into Wednesday morning as
a result. Winds will calm by Tuesday evening, so the clear skies 
and light winds will contribute to radiational cooling overnight 
and help lows by Wednesday morning to drop into the 30s to low 40s
areawide.

Winds become southerly and the upper level flow shifts to a zonal
orientation by midweek, so expect a gradual warming trend to 
bring temperatures back to seasonal normals. Highs Wednesday and 
Thursday are expected to be in the upper 60s to mid 70s with 
overnight lows in the upper 40s to mid 50s.

By late Thursday, a second shortwave will approach from the west 
and bring rain chances back to the forecast. There is some model 
disagreement regarding the speed/timing of this system, with the 
GFS pushing it through Texas much faster than the ECMWF. 
Regardless, another round of much needed rainfall and another shot
of colder air will close out the work week. For now, the official
forecast sides more closely to the GFS and has rain and storm
chances beginning Thursday afternoon/evening and ending from west
to east overnight Friday. Near to below normal temperatures will 
be in store for next weekend behind the cold front, and once the 
system moves east, cool, dry conditions will prevail for the 
remainder of the weekend.

.AVIATION... /Issued 152 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022/
/18Z TAFs/

Concerns... 
Today: Gusty southerly winds continue. 
Tonight: MVFR moves in with continued windy conditions. 
Tomorrow: Rain develops in the AM; storm chances increase by late
morning through the afternoon. MVFR through the end of the TAF 
cycle. 

Windy conditions will continue through the rest of today as 
speeds remain in the 15-20 mph range with gusts between 30-35 mph.
Given the southerly direction, crosswind concerns remain minimal 
for much of the region. 

As we move into tonight, weather conditions will be changing as
moisture increases through the region and a shroud of stratus 
invades from the south. MVFR is expected to cover the region 
around midnight, with a gradual development of rain showers mainly
along and west of I-35. As a weather system approaches the 
region, we'll see an uptick in thunderstorm development, initially
across areas west of the D10 airspace. By mid-morning, the threat
for widespread shower and thunderstorm activity increases as one 
system moves overhead. At this time, the main window for 
thunderstorm activity remains between 15-20Z with variable and 
erratic winds expected as the storms move through. Expect 
additional refinements to the TAF as models converge on a more 
specific timing for storm impacts. Wind direction in the wake of 
the afternoon convection is likely to remain variable given the 
cold front still well to the west of our region. Given that is 
beyond this forecast cycle, expect wind direction refinements to 
be made through the next 24 hours.
