Fire Weather Planning Forecast for Texas
National Weather Service Fort Worth TX
152 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

.DISCUSSION...
Fire weather concerns will be low for the upcoming week. Two cold
fronts are forecast to push through the region this week and usher
in widespread rainfall and cooler temperatures. The first front is
expected on Monday. Gusty north winds will follow on Tuesday, but
the widespread wetting rains expected on Monday and below normal
temperatures behind the front should keep fire weather concerns 
at bay. A gradual warming trend will follow before the second
cold front arrives on Friday. Widespread rainfall and cooler
temperatures will accompany this front as well.
