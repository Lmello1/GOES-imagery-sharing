.SHORT TERM ...
(This evening through tonight)
Issued at 223 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Obs have shown southwest winds this afternoon blowing around 20 to
40 mph with gusts of 40s and 50s common. We have seen a few gusts
in the 60s as well today. Temps are increasing to the 90s in the
northeast where there is abundant sunshine and downsloping.
Satellite is shown cloud cover over the southeastern Panhandles,
which is keeping temps in the 70s currently. Pacific moisture
looks to continue streaming through that area, keeping clouds
around for the afternoon. This is also limiting the wind gusts
from reaching stronger levels in the is area. As the sun sets,
mixing will get cut off, and winds will ease back. The cold front
is on track to reach the northern Panhandles around 4 or 5 AM and
slowly turn winds northwesterly before going northerly during the
day. The moisture across the southeast will also bring rain
chances as a mid-level shortwave comes over the area. As the front
comes in, that will increase the rain chances northward overnight.

.LONG TERM ...
(Monday through next Saturday)
Issued at 223 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

A cold front is expected to be mostly through the Panhandles by
early to mid-morning tomorrow with the surface winds shifting from
west southwest to north. Pacific moisture will wrap around the
southern tip of the trough axis into West Texas. A strong 500mb
jet axis with ample lift ahead of the positively tilted trough
across the Rockies will give way to shower and thunderstorm
development tomorrow morning. Due to the orientation of the trough
and jet, the rain chances will favor the southern and eastern 
Panhandles through the morning hours. The base of the upper 
trough will develop a closed low over New Mexico by tomorrow 
afternoon with ample mid-level moisture still present. As the
closed low swings eastward, the path is still centered just south
of the Texas Panhandle near Lubbock. This will taper rain chances
across the Oklahoma Panhandle tomorrow afternoon and evening,
while the better chances remain in the southern Texas Panhandle
with the wrap around moisture on the north side of the closed low.
A few thunderstorms may develop tomorrow across the southern Texas
Panhandle, but no severe weather is expected. As the upper low
continues eastward tomorrow night, rain chances will taper from
northwest to southeast across the Panhandles. As temperatures drop
tomorrow night, there may be a few areas in the southwest Texas
Panhandle to see a flurry or two with no impacts.

Given the rain showers tomorrow and persistent cloud cover,
temperatures are expected to remain cool in the 50s across the
area. By tomorrow night, temperatures across the northwest
Panhandles may drop below freezing with clearing skies and fairly
light winds. In addition, a few localized locations across the far
northwest Panhandles may even see the first hard freeze of the
season.

Tuesday through Thursday will remain dry and cool with 
temperatures in the 60s to lower 70s before the next system swings
into the Four Corners region from the Pacific Northwest by 
Thursday afternoon. Model variability continues for Thursday and 
Friday with the timing and location of this next system playing a 
key role in where the better moisture will setup. If the upper low
digs farther south quicker, then much of the precipitation will 
miss the Panhandles to the south and east. Therefore, rainfall 
chances will be adjusted through the week as the models come to a 
consensus on the track and speed of the next system. Overall, 
another cold front will likely push through the Panhandles 
Thursday night and help keep temperatures cool in the 50s and 60s 
through next weekend.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1228 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Sites are currently VFR. Southwest winds will gust in the south to
near 40 kts, and will need monitoring for an AWW for winds if we 
start seeing winds increase. Wind gusts in the north may get 
upwards of 50-55 kts this afternoon. After 00Z, gusts will ease
back and by 03-06Z, gusts should subside. A cold front is expected
to push through from north to south and turn winds northerly after
08Z. Rain can be expected around the Panhandles in the morning.
There may be some rain in the early morning hours, but confidence
of a shower at a terminal is too low attm to include. Clouds will
lower with the front and rain showers to lower cigs to MVFR or
possibly IFR conditions.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 223 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

So far, seeing RFTI values up to 4. RH values have remained in the
20s in the north and 40s in the south with the cloud cover. Winds
have been reaching sustained of 20 to 40 mph and gusts of 40s to
50s are common around the Panhandles. The critical and elevated
fire weather conditions should subside around 8 PM. The cold front
looks to be just east of the Nebraska Panhandle and draped back
into northern Colorado. It is on track to get to the OK Panhandle
around 4 or 5 AM and slowly turn winds northwesterly before
turning northerly during the daytime hours. Rain is possible ahead
of the front overnight, starting in the southeast and spreading
northward. Chances remain low end, 20 percent, until the front
arrives. When the front pushes through, rain chances will
increase.
