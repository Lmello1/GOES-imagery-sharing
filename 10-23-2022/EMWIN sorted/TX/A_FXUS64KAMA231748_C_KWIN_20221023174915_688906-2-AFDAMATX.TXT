Overview
A windy day is anticipated today across the area, with the
north/northwestern parts of the area favored for the strongest 
wind speeds. Sustained wind speeds will likely be around 25-35 mph
for most of the area, but northern parts of the area could see 
those sustained speeds closer to 40 mph. Gusts will range between 
35 and 50 mph, but areas in the north may be closer to the 50-60 
mph range. This is going to warrant a high wind warning for 
northern parts of the area, while a wind advisory will be in 
place elsewhere minus southern parts of the TX Panhandles. The 
above normal temperatures and dry conditions will also lead to a 
threat of fire weather this afternoon. This will be favored across
the north and north east where caution should be exhibited with 
any outdoor sparks or flames. High profile vehicles may be 
susceptible to rollovers in the stronger wind speeds, and any 
unsecured/loose outdoor objects may be tossed around or damaged 
today.

Further Details:
A robust H5 closed low is expected to pass over the western CONUS
today within a longwave trough. As this system edges closer to the
Rockies, it will induce strong lee cyclogenesis. Winds at 300mb
are progged to be around 120-130 knots, 80-90 knots at 500mb, and
50-60 knots at 700mb. At the surface, we are expecting a strong
surface low to form over eastern parts of Colorado. This will
allow for a strong pressure gradient over the Panhandles today.
During peak heating/mixing, we are likely to see strong wind
speeds occur as the strong stacked jet passes over. Fortunately,
wind speeds will calm down around sunset, but will likely stay on
the breezy side all night around 15-25 mph. A cold front may slide
through tonight, and this will turn the winds from the north with
speeds only around 10-15 mph as the front start to enter the 
area. 

Later today, there is another potential closed low off the coast
of Baja California that is progged to merge with the main longwave
trough over the western CONUS. As this gets ingested into the mean
flow, positive vorticity advection may spread over the Panhandles
tonight in conjunction with the passing front. Most of the area 
is dry today (hence the fire weather concerns), but dewpoints in 
the southeastern TX Panhandle may be in the 50s this afternoon. 
Given the front and passing energy aloft, cannot rule out shower 
activity increasing as early as tonight in the southeast. While 
an isolated thunderstorm will be possible, we are not expecting 
severe weather today or tonight. Rainfall amounts in this period 
will generally be light.

.LONG TERM ...
(Tuesday through Saturday)
Issued at 330 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Showers along with a thunderstorm or two should be ongoing across 
much of the Panhandles at sunrise Monday in association with a 
shearing out upper level low that once was off the coast of northern 
Baja California.  This first batch of rain is expected to move off 
to the northeast by early afternoon and then the next batch of rain 
is expected to move into the southwest Texas Panhandle by mid 
afternoon.  This second batch of rain will be in association with an 
upper level low that will be passing just to our south.  This rain 
is expected to affect mainly the southern half of the Texas 
Panhandle during the rest of the afternoon into the evening hours. 
Rain will depart the southeast Texas Panhandle during the early 
morning hours on Tuesday.  Clouds should decrease from northwest to 
southeast across the area.  If clouds can clear out quickly enough, 
then we may see some freezing temperatures across the western and 
central Oklahoma Panhandle and the northwest Texas Panhandle.

Another closed upper level low is expected to bring another shot of 
rain to the Panhandles mainly Thursday night into Friday morning. It 
looks like this next system continues to be moving a little further 
south with each model run, so the southern Texas Panhandle may be 
favored again.

High temperatures will be generally in the 60's across the area this 
work week.  However, readings will likely stay in the 50's on Monday 
given the chance of rain.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1228 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Sites are currently VFR. Southwest winds will gust in the south to
near 40 kts, and will need monitoring for an AWW for winds if we 
start seeing winds increase. Wind gusts in the north may get 
upwards of 50-55 kts this afternoon. After 00Z, gusts will ease
back and by 03-06Z, gusts should subside. A cold front is expected
to push through from north to south and turn winds northerly after
08Z. Rain can be expected around the Panhandles in the morning.
There may be some rain in the early morning hours, but confidence
of a shower at a terminal is too low attm to include. Clouds will
lower with the front and rain showers to lower cigs to MVFR or
possibly IFR conditions.

.FIRE WEATHER...

Today:

Within the Red Flag warning, ERC values are expected to be around
the 70th to 89th percentile this afternoon. RFTI values will be
around 4, but there is no RH component today as values may only
drop down to around (or above) 20 percent during peak heating.
Sustained wind speeds of 25-35 mph will be common today, but 
there is a chance those could be as high as 40 mph in the north. 
Gusts will be around 35-50 mph but upwards near 50-60 mph at times
in the north. Given the strong wind speeds expected today, there 
is a concern for fire weather across the Oklahoma Panhandle and 
northeastern parts of the TX Panhandle where receptive fuels may 
be located. Lastly, with the frontal passage, there is a concern 
for a wind shift overnight, so any fire suppression activities 
should make note of the possibility for a frontal passage starting
around midnight.
