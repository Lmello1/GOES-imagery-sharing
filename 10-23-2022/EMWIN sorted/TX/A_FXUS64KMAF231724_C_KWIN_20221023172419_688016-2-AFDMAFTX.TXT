.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Monday afternoon)
Issued at 210 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

A significant pattern shift is underway this morning across 
Southeast New Mexico and West Texas, as moisture continues to 
increase over the region ahead of a deepening trough currently 
progressing into the Great Basin. Dewpoints across the area are 
solidly in the 50s, with the exception of the higher terrain where 
dewpoints remain in the upper 40s. Expectation is for dewpoints to
continue increasing as a fetch of subtropical moisture associated
with Hurricane Roslyn over western Mexico is routed northward 
over the next 24-36 hours, coincident with a strengthening 
southerly low-level jet over the Permian Basin and Lower Trans 
Pecos acting as a conveyor for Gulf moisture. Temperatures this 
morning are on the mild side given the uptick in moisture, still 
holding in the 60s areawide. Given falling heights ahead of the 
approaching trough as well as increasing cloud cover, high 
temperatures will be a bit cooler than yesterday, ranging from the
70s across western areas and the higher terrain to middle/upper 
80s elsewhere. 

A southern stream jet is currently moving across the region ahead
of the aforementioned trough, and while intermittent high wind 
gusts have been observed at Pine Springs and at The Bowl in the 
Guadalupe Mountains, a more significant and widespread high wind 
event for the Guadalupe Mountains is expected to begin today, 
where a High Wind Warning remains in effect. While a brief lull in
winds is forecast during the late evening and early overnight 
hours tonight, winds will increase fairly substantially late 
tonight through tomorrow across the Guadalupe Mountains, thus, 
have extended the current Warning through early Tuesday evening. 
The highest gusts of 65-75mph are expected across the higher 
terrain, though a few 60mph+ gusts will be possible through 
Guadalupe Pass, particularly today, given a favored southwesterly 
wind direction before winds shift more to the west on Monday. As 
the trough continues to deepen and translate eastward across the 
Rockies, the southern stream jet will phase with the jet rounding 
the base of the trough, resulting in an uptick in wind speeds 
areawide by late morning Monday. Have hoisted a High Wind Watch 
for the Davis and Chinati Mountains for Monday, and while Advisory
conditions are expected across adjacent areas, will wait for 
later forecast packages to pin down timing/location for any 
additional wind products.

In addition to the winds, precipitation returns to the forecast  
tonight through Monday. Current water vapor imagery indicates an 
open shortwave just west of Baja, which will quickly translate 
eastward around the base of the larger scale trough, and move over 
the region tonight. Moisture ahead of this feature as well as 
substantial increasing lift will yield increasing rain chances 
beginning early this evening from the Presidio Valley 
northeastward across the Trans Pecos and into the Permian Basin, 
with rain chances increasing and expanding areawide through 
daybreak, when scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms 
will be possible. Convection is expected to be higher-based across
western areas, though a weak dryline is progged to develop along 
the edge of the boundary-layer Gulf Moisture plume over the 
Permian Basin and Lower Trans Pecos, which could allow for storms 
to become better rooted in the boundary layer toward daybreak as 
the shortwave translates across the region. While instability will
be limited, ample shear and forcing could result in a few strong 
to marginally severe storms across eastern areas early Monday 
morning with gusty winds and hail the primary concerns. Rain 
chances will linger across northern and eastern areas through 
Monday afternoon in closer proximity to the trough's associated 
surface low and Pacific Front as it moves into the Plains. The 
combination of wind, cloud cover, precipitation, and a rapidly 
cooling column associated with the aforementioned trough will 
yield much cooler and well below normal temperatures region-wide 
on Monday. Have currently undercut the NBM guidance by several 
degrees, with highs Monday forecast to range from the upper 
40s/lower 50s across the higher terrain to 60s and lower 70s 
across the plains, and 80s through the Rio Grande Valley. The 
timing of the Pacific front will largely dictate temperatures on 
Monday, though expect many locations to reach high temperatures 
early in the day before temperatures fall through the afternoon.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday night through Saturday)
Issued at 210 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

By Mon night-early Tue AM the wx will have settled with favorable 
radiational cooling conditions across all areas, especially with 
light nw sfc winds favoring local cold air drainage in some 
locales. In fact a light freeze is likely across the Marfa Plateau
and northern Lea Co, and will be possible in the higher 
elevations of the GDP and Davis Mtns. Freeze Watch will likely be 
needed. Cool conditions will carry over into Tue PM with below 
normal high temps. Still cool into Wed AM and about 5 degrees 
warmer Wed PM as zonal mid-level just starts to back ahead the 
next mid/upper low. Flow continues to amplify going into Thur and 
the low-level thermal ridge signals further warming aided by pre-
frontal downslope winds. There are large discrepancies wrt timing 
of mid/upper trof's passage and 00Z/Sun data is much different 
from that 24hrs prior. The assocd Pacific cold front will pass 
overnight and into Fri AM with the possibility of precip. We 
expect there will continue to be different solutions presented by 
the models, although NBM spreads for high temps on Fri are 
actually narrow. ATTP no reason to deviate. Thereafter warming 
looks to be slow at best with normal to below normal temps favored
into next weekend.

(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1213 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Current satellite shows wave clouds forming in the lee of the
Guadalupe Mountains near CNM indicating turbulence and the
potential for gusty winds to mix to the surface as noted at ATS.
Other locations will be gusty but speeds will be lower. Winds
relax slightly tonight before increasing from the west again after
12Z tomorrow. Light showers are possible 06-15Z but confidence is
decreasing and have left out for now. VFR conditions should
continue.
