.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 311 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

A broad mid to upper level ridge continues to dominate over the 
southern plains this morning. The low level flow is from the south 
to southeast bringing warm, moist air to the region. Today the upper 
pattern will begin to transition as the ridge moves toward the east. 
As this happens our weather will remain dry and very warm. High 
temperatures will be well above normal in the middle to upper 80s. 
Big pattern changes come tonight. The mid to upper level flow will 
turn southwesterly as a trough moves into northwestern Mexico. This 
trough will pull the remnants of Hurricane Roslyn across central 
Mexico and into South Texas. This will bring the first chance for 
rain to our CWA. Rain chances will spread from west to east through 
the night. Monday the mid to upper trough will move across the 
southwestern US into West Texas bringing a cold front toward our 
CWA. This will bring better forcing for convection and increased 
POPs. Higher POPs will move across the northern half of the area 
closer to the front. The front will enter Val Verde County around 
noon Monday and continue toward the east during the afternoon. 
Rainfall amounts look to be moderate with PW values mainly 1.5" and 
less. Thus, rain totals during the day Monday will be up to around 
0.5". With the cloud cover and rain temperatures will be bit cooler, 
but still above normal. Temperatures will be lower across the north.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday night through Saturday)
Issued at 311 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

The above mentioned cold front will make steady eastward progress
across our region Monday evening into early Tuesday morning. Low-
level forcing along the front combined with mid and upper level
support from an upper level trough axis will aid in the development
of a line of showers and storms. SPC continues to highlight a portion
of south central Texas, mainly along and east of the I-35 corridor
for severe thunderstorm development during the late evening and early
morning hours. The latest outlook has increased to the Slight risk
(level 2 out of 5) for areas along and east of I-35, with a Marginal
risk (level 1 out of 5) farther west into the Hill country and
southern Edwards Plateau. Damaging wind gusts appear to be the main
threat as this line of convection moves through the region. A low-end
tornado potential can not be ruled out where surface low development
occurs along the frontal boundary. 

With the cold front expected to move east of the region by sunrise
Tuesday, precipitation chances will end quickly. Behind the front,
look for gusty northwest winds and cooler temperatures. A few spots
may briefly approach Wind Advisory levels (sustained 26 mph) across
the Hill Country and nearby I-35 corridor. At this time our
confidence is too low to go with any headlines, but this will need 
to be monitored. Weak high pressure remains over central and east 
Texas Tuesday night into Wednesday morning. Clear skies, dry air and 
light winds will allow overnight lows to drop into the lower 40s to 
lower 50s. Surface high pressure moves east on Wednesday, allowing 
for a gradual return of east to southeast flow in the low-levels.

Meanwhile, our next weather system of interest (upper low) will be 
developing over the Rockies. Ahead of this low, we will see an
increase in low-level southerly flow across the region. There are
some timing differences with regard to the next upper system, but it
does appear a fairly stout Pacific front will move through late
Thursday or early Friday. The quality of moisture return ahead of 
this next upper system and Pacific cold front remain in question. We 
do expect some shower and thunderstorm activity on Thursday and
Friday, with rain chances currently favored from the Hill Country
eastward into the I-35 corridor and coastal plains. It will be windy
and cooler behind the front on Friday and Saturday. The NBM guidance
looks too warm for Saturday, so we did opt to go with highs in the
upper 60s to mid 70s for most areas.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1246 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Gusty winds to around 28 knots along I-35 should hasten low level 
mixing and push stratus to VFR levels for nearly all areas by around 
20Z. Relatively lower cigs may linger most over the Rio Grande where 
energy and moisture from Roslyn have already begun to impact cloud 
cover. Areas of stratus should form more readily after 00Z and
periods of IFR cigs are exected for most areas late tonight. By 09Z
some scattered showers should begin to move toward the I-35 corridor,
but will show more active conditions at 12Z and afterwards. Isolated
storms will become possible, but mainly in the 24-30 hour time frame.
