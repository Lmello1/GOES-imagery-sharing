.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 230 PM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Lowland rain and mountain snow showers are expected through
Monday with generally light accumulations. Temperatures will be
noticeably cooler, with values in the mid 50s to mid 60s, and
overnight lows in the 30s. Tuesday and Wednesday will be dry and 
quiet, then the next system brings breezy conditions Thursday
afternoon, with a slight chance for showers.

.SHORT TERM...
(This evening through Monday)
Issued at 230 PM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Satellite currently shows rippling clouds across much of the CWA. 
This is usually an indication of strong winds aloft. These winds 
were measured this morning on the 12Z EPZ RAOB, and showed 40 
knots up at 3,500ft and increasing with height. A 60-70knot jet at
500mb is moving over the CWA this afternoon as a strong upper 
level trough bottoms out over NM. At the same time, a cut off low 
over the CA Baja starts to open up and move eastward. Observations
have been showing surface winds of around 20-30 mph with gusts up
to 40mph in the lower elevations. Winds above 7000ft are seeing 
gusts of 55- 65mph. These winds will continue into the later hours
tonight, as the two pieces of energy mentioned above phase over 
the CWA. Winds will slowly start to diminish after sunset, but 
remain gusty into Monday. 

As the open wave over Northern MX phases with the larger upper level 
trough, it will kick some moisture northward with it. Enough lift 
and moisture will exist tonight for area wide light to moderate rain 
showers below 7000ft and eventually snow above 7500ft. Little 
instability exists, pointing to low confidence in embedded 
thunderstorms. As lower heights aloft move in overnight, and drier 
continental air takes over, snow levels will begin to fall after 
midnight to around 7000-7500ft. As the larger trough continues 
southeast ward early Monday morning, it begins to accelerate as it 
starts to trend towards a negative tilt. This will provide more lift 
over the Sacramento Mountains, allowing for snow to fall until noon 
Monday. Snow chances also exist for higher areas in the Gila Region, 
but accumulations will be light. Areas above 7500ft in the 
Sacramento Mountains could see up to 1-3 inches of snow by Monday 
afternoon (4-5 inches on the highest peaks like Sierra Blanca). 
There is some uncertainty in snow accumulations since precipitation 
will most likely start as rain from 9 pm to midnight, then 
transition to snow. The ground will probably be too warm still for 
much ice to form, however there is a chance for ice and slick roads. 
Temperatures will be dropping over night and into the morning hours, 
so please drive carefully as temperatures fall. 

Monday morning, the upper level trough continues it way eastward and 
starts to exit the CWA. Low clouds and light rain (snow in higher 
terrain of Sacs) will linger through mid day, then clear out. A cold 
front will pass over in the morning brining breezy conditions with 
it. Colder and drier air behind the front will settle in and leave 
breezy northwest winds for the remainder of the afternoon. Wind 
speeds will be around 10-20mph less than today, but still breezy 
along the US/MX border. 

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Monday night through next Saturday)
Issued at 230 PM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022

By Monday evening-overnight, northwest flow behind the front and 
system will advect dry, cool, and lower momentum air into the 
Borderland. Consequently, temperatures will drop Monday night, 
with early morning low temperatures on Tuesday in the 20s across 
area mountains and 30s across the lowlands. Expect dry west flow 
aloft Tuesday and Wednesday, clear skies, and temperatures in the 
mid 60s to mid 70s.

On Thursday afternoon, a fast moving upper level system will dive
into New Mexico and skim the northern half of the forecast area.
GFS/ECM seem to be a little further south, but nevertheless,
mountain pops seem to be the safest bet for this event (possible
wintry), with an slight chance across portions of the lowlands.
Amounts look to be light at this time. Winds will increase into 
the breezy to low end windy category as well. This will be a fast
moving system and so by Friday morning, the storm will be to the 
east with dry air transport inbound and cooler conditions. High 
temperatures on Friday will struggle to reach the mid 60s. 

The rest of the period, next weekend into early next week, will be
quiet and dry with a few afternoon breezes here and there.
Temperatures will be pleasant, ranging from the mid 60s to mid
70s.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1218 PM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022

VFR conditions through much of the period for all sites. SW winds
are currently 20-30kts G30-35kts. Gusts could occasionally reach
40kts within the next 6 hours at all sites. An AWW is out for KELP
due to strong winds. Winds will slightly diminish overnight,
however gusts will remain 25-35kts through ~15Z. Chances for
SHRA/-RA will move over the area from W to E starting after 06Z.
VCSH after 15Z as showers move out of the area. Cigs should remain
VFR, with vis reductions near moderate rain showers (chances are
low for this at sites). Winds will remain breezy Monday afternoon,
however 5-10kts less than today. 

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 230 PM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Unsettled weather continues through Monday. Windy conditions 
today will linger through the night tonight. Scattered rain 
showers overnight tonight through noon tomorrow, with 
precipitation turning to snow for elevations above 7000ft after 
midnight. Tomorrow, winds will remain breezy but will weaken 
through the day. Modest winds return into midweek before another 
system moves in on Thursday, bringing breezy winds and a chance of
rain for northern areas. Fire danger may be a concern on Thursday
with lower humidity. Much lower temperatures for Monday, staying 
below average through the week. 

Min RHs will range from 25-40% in the lowlands and 40-65% in the 
mountains today, falling to 15-30% and 25-45% on Tuesday. 
Ventilation rates range from very good to excellent through Monday 
and then on Thursday, otherwise will be poor to fair.
