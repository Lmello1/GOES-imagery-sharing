Fire Weather Planning Forecast for West Texas/Southeast New Mexico
National Weather Service Midland/Odessa TX
211 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

.DISCUSSION...

Breezy conditions today will continue through Monday as the next
disturbances pushes through the area. Recent rains have aided in 
moistening fuels for the last few weeks and will get a little more
assistance with scattered precip over the the Permian Basin and 
Southeast NM tomorrow morning and afternoon. We'll see low temperatures
on Tuesday morning around freezing for the Marfa Plateau and Davis Mtns
so a freeze is increasingly likely for the high terrain in SW TX. A 
dry day with min RHs on Tuesday between 11-20% areawide will be the 
forecast, but more moisture will encompass the area ahead of the next
disturbance by the end of the week. Low fire weather concerns given the 
above.
