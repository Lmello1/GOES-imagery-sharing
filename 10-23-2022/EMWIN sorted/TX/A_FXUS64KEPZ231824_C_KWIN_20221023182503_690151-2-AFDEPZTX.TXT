.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 330 AM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022

An upper level storm system brings windy to very windy conditions
across the region today and tomorrow. The strongest winds will be
over area mountains, including ridges, passes and the eastern 
slopes. This system also brings isolated to scattered rain showers 
and a few thunderstorms. Tonight, there is a chance for snow in 
the Gila Region and the Sacramento Mountains above 7500 feet. Snow
accumulations should be less than 2 inches. Fair weather is 
expected once this system leaves the area on Monday night. Another
quick upper system is expected on Thursday. This system brings 
another round of windy conditions, rain, a few thunderstorms, and 
mountain snow showers. Drier and warmer weather returns this
weekend.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 330 AM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022

The much-talked about weather maker has finally arrived. Early this 
morning, we have already seen nocturnal convection develop over the 
Gila Region and into Sierra county. An area of MUCAPE of over 500 
J/kg along with some positive vorticity advection seems to be the 
culprit of the activity. Lightning has been prevalent with these 
storms as they are tracking northeast at around 40kts but are 
weakening. There have also been some showers in the Sacramento Mtns 
which may turn convective as well this morning as the weak impulse 
treks to the east. Additionally, we have already seen some strong 
gusts in the past few hours, reaching over 75 mph at Salinas Peak 
and into the 50s on the east slopes of the San Andres.

The main story for today will be the southwest winds ramping up 
ahead of the trough. The pressure gradient continues to tighten with 
brisk to strong southwest winds aloft, reaching over 50kts at 700mb. 
Some of that flow will mix down and reach the surface in the form of 
sustained winds of 20 to 30 mph and gusts into the 40s in most 
areas. Downsloping effects may produce even stronger flow east of 
mountains as has been seen early this morning off the San Andres.
The Sacramento Mtns and Black Range will be the big winners and see 
gusts in the 50s and possibly 60s during the day, so a High Wind 
Warning has been issued for those zones (until 0z for Black Range 
and until 3z for Sacs). Breezy winds persist for the overnight. The 
winds across the region may knock over loose objects or bring down 
tree branches, so it would be best to secure things that may fall 
over. Damages to buildings are possible as well. Patchy blowing dust 
and reduced visibility may occur along the Mexico border, especially 
further west, if soils are dry enough to be picked up.

The plume of moisture that is currently giving most areas some cloud 
cover/precipitation will be nudged to the southeast as the longwave 
trough moves in. PW's will drop to around 0.4-0.5 inches which is 
just about normal for late October. The Gila Region generally clears 
out after sunrise as the Sacs should still see lingering showers, 
otherwise we stay dry during the day. Partly cloudy skies are 
expected for most areas today with increasing clouds into the 
evening as a shortwave joins up with the main system from the 
southwest. This merging of systems will allow tropical moisture to 
return and give us a better chance of more widespread shower 
activity. PW's won't be as high as they were Saturday evening but 
still above normal. 

Scattered showers will develop Sunday night as the troughs merge 
with the activity expected to be relatively light. Some heavier 
embedded showers and possibly a thunderstorm are possible into early 
Monday morning. Temperatures will also be dropping while the 
trough's axis approaches, enough for rain to mix with or change over 
to snow in the higher elevations of the Black Range/Gila Region. 
Through Sunday night, snow accumulations up to an inch are possible 
in the highest mountains to the northwest. High temperatures today 
will be a few degrees cooler than Saturday while our geopotential 
heights decrease. Our lows tonight will be near or a few degrees 
above average.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 330 AM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Upper system remains in the area for one more day. The associated
cold front will be descending from the north during the morning
hours. Rain chances persist with the passage of the front in the
lowlands. Snow showers remain in the forecast for the mountain
areas above 7500 feet including the Gila Region, Black Range and
the Sacramento Mountains. Snow accumulations will be around 1-2 
inches with localized higher amounts in the highest elevations of 
area mountains. At the moment, we are not expecting to issue any 
winter products. 

The trough axis will be east of the region by Monday evening. In
the meantime, we are still expecting breezy to windy conditions 
on Monday, as we continue to observe a tight pressure gradient at 
the surface behind the front. Winds between 15 to 30 mph with 
gusts to 45 mph are expected with the strongest winds over in 
Hudspeth county.

Monday night into Tuesday morning, northwest flow settles in the
area which will continue to advect a colder air mass. Lighter
winds, mostly clear skies, and drier conditions will lead to a
colder morning across the region. The Gila Region including the
Black Range, and the Sacramento Mountains are expected to drop 
below freezing. In the lowlands, many locations will be flirting
with freezing conditions especially in the valleys and open desert
areas in southern New Mexico. El Paso appears to remain in the
mid to upper 30s, while Hudspeth county remains in the mid 30s. 

On Tuesday and Wednesday, a quasi zonal flow dominates the weather
pattern, as another upper trough from the Pacific Northwest 
slowly descends through the Rockies. Fair weather and warmer 
conditions are expected on both days. This upper trough becomes
another closed low near the Four Corners area bringing more active
weather for southern NM and far west TX on Thursday. Breezy to 
windy conditions, lowland rain and mountain snow showers are 
expected again with this system. An important detail to note is 
that it will be a quick system affecting us only on Thursday. By 
Friday, a high pressure area moves in resulting in warmer and 
drier weather through the weekend.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1218 PM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022

VFR conditions through much of the period for all sites. SW winds
are currently 20-30kts G30-35kts. Gusts could occasionally reach
40kts within the next 6 hours at all sites. An AWW is out for KELP
due to strong winds. Winds will slightly diminish overnight,
however gusts will remain 25-35kts through ~15Z. Chances for
SHRA/-RA will move over the area from W to E starting after 06Z.
VCSH after 15Z as showers move out of the area. Cigs should remain
VFR, with vis reductions near moderate rain showers (chances are
low for this at sites). Winds will remain breezy Monday afternoon,
however 5-10kts less than today. 

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 330 AM MDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Active weather is expected through Monday with brisk to windy 
conditions. Gusts should reach into the 40s across the lowlands 
today from the southwest and in the 50s in the mountains and eastern 
slopes. For tomorrow, our winds stay brisk, gusting up to 40 mph and 
shifting northwesterly with scattered showers through the morning. 
Modest winds return into midweek before another system moves in on 
Thursday, bringing breezy winds and a chance of rain for northern 
areas. Fire danger may be a concern on Thursday with lower humidity. 
Much lower temperatures for Monday, staying below average through 
the week. 

Min RHs will range from 25-40% in the lowlands and 40-65% in the 
mountains today, falling to 15-30% and 25-45% on Tuesday. 
Ventilation rates range from very good to excellent through Monday 
and then on Thursday, otherwise will be poor to fair.
