.UPDATE...
Issued at 838 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

While swell periods are expected to remain below 8 seconds, with
elevated seas and strong onshore flow, have updated the Rip 
Current Risk to high for today and tonight. 

Increased the mention of thunderstorms for Monday/Monday night to
chance for most of the area. There will be a few hours where
thunderstorms will be likely across the northern Coastal
Plains/Victoria Crossroads Monday night. SPC has much of the area
in a Slight Risk for severe weather, with a Marginal Risk of
severe weather for the rest of the CWA.

.SHORT TERM...
(Today through Monday)
Issued at 432 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Concur with the GFS/ECMWF/NAM that an upper disturbance will move
across The Rockies today, then across the central/northern Plains
tonight/Monday, while another upper system moves across Baja 
California and merges with the northern system Monday. The bulk of
the upper forcing will remain north of the CWA, yet weak 
700-300mb Q-vector convergence is predicted to move across the CWA
Monday. The associated upper jet streak is not expected to 
provide synoptic scale lift to the CWA until Monday night. The 
GFS/HiResW-FV3 suggest that a prefrontal trough will enter the 
western CWA Monday afternoon. PWAT values are expected to increase
to above normal over the central/western CWA this afternoon, then
areawide tonight/Monday. Isolated convection may develop over the
western CWA after 06z Monday in response to increasing moisture/ 
slight increase in upper forcing. Scattered showers/isolated 
thunderstorms are expected Monday, especially over the Victoria 
Crossroads. Will maintain a low risk of rip currents owing to 
expected longshore flow and less than 8 second swell periods.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday night through next Saturday)
Issued at 432 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Key Messages:

- Cold front expected Monday night

- Small Craft Advisory condition likely to continue through Tuesday 
afternoon

- Another cold front expected late next week

With models showing above-average moisture (PWATs from 1.8-2.0"; 
~80th percentile of climatology) across South Texas Monday night, 
scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms are expected to develop 
ahead and along the cold front. The cold front is expected to sweep 
across the CWA Monday night and clear the coastal waters by Tuesday 
afternoon. Significantly drier air is expected to filter into the 
area in the wake of the front with PWATs around 0.50". The drier 
airmass will remain in place through Wednesday before moisture 
begins to increase with the return of onshore flow Thursday. With 
the increase in moisture and another cold front expected to sweep 
across the region late next week, rain chances are expected to 
return to the eastern half of the CWA. 

Temperatures Tuesday and Wednesday are expected to cool into upper 
70s to lower 80s in the wake of the cold front. As onshore flow 
returns around mid-week next week, temperatures will begin to 
gradually increase ahead of the arrival of our next front late next 
week. Cooler temperatures are anticipated to return to the area next 
weekend behind the second front. Overnight lows Tuesday night will 
drop into the lower to mid 50s inland and lower to mid 60s along the 
coast. Low temperatures will begin to gradually warm up from mid-
week to late next week before dropping back into the 50s next 
weekend.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1153 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

We'll see more clouds than we have in the last few days as
moisture streams into the area. Conditions will remain VFR through
today and most of tonight, though ceilings will begin to lower by
around 06Z for most sites. Isolated showers are possible today for
CRP and VCT though chances are low enough that there is no mention
in the TAFs. MVFR ceilings are expected by 12Z across South Texas
as more moisture and an upper level disturbance push across the
area. Chances for showers will increase Monday afternoon. South to
southeasterly winds will be strong, with gusts to around 30 knots.
General aviation interests should use caution.

.MARINE...
Issued at 432 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Predominately strong onshore flow expected today through Monday. 
Increasing moisture and an approaching upper level disturbance 
will contribute to isolated convection expected Monday afternoon.
A cold front is expected sweep across the region Monday night 
which will promote scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms 
across the local waters. With strong winds expected to persist 
ahead and behind the front, Small Craft Advisory conditions are 
expected to continue through Tuesday afternoon, with winds 
shifting from the north Tuesday morning. Winds are expected to 
relax to moderate levels Tuesday evening before increasing to 
stronger levels once again late next week ahead of a second cold 
front.
