.DISCUSSION...

Another round of gusty south winds and above normal temperatures
will be in store today. With plenty of moisture and clouds in
place, minimum humidity levels will range from near 40 to near 50
percent. An upper level disturbance, Pacific front, and the 
remnants of Hurricane Roslyn in the Eastern Pacific will bring 
chances of showers and thunderstorms from overnight tonight into 
Monday and Monday night. Behind the front, a drier and slightly 
cooler airmass prevails midweek. Elevated to near critical fire 
weather concerns will be possible Tuesday afternoon, particularly 
to any areas that miss out on rainfall with this event. Another 
cold front will bring a chance for showers and thunderstorms 
Thursday night and Friday.
