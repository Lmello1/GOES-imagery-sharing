.SHORT TERM...
(This afternoon through Monday night)
Issued at 246 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Strong winds have been observed in the Guadalupe Mountains since 
this morning and this will continue into tomorrow as a deep upper 
level low digs into New Mexico. The focus of the strong winds will 
shift from the Guadalupes early Monday to the Davis Mountains later 
in the days as the low moves east and strong winds behind the low 
mix into the higher elevations. Unfortunately rain chances are 
beginning to look more uncertain for the western two thirds of the 
CWA. Isolated to widely scattered showers and storms will develop 
across much of the area tonight, however the low will push a 
prefrontal trough east ahead of the front and with it will go the 
best low level moisture. A line of showers and storms will form in 
along the trough in the eastern Basin and quickly push east out 
of the area into the Low Rolling Plains. 

High pressure will quickly build in behind the front and become 
settled over the Trans Pecos Tuesday morning. Light northwesterly 
winds and clear skies will be favorable for maximum radiational 
cooling and Tuesday morning will be the coldest morning of the 
season. Have issued a Freeze Watch for the Davis Mountains and Marfa 
Plateau where guidance is indicating temperatures will drop below 
freezing for the first time, and could actually drop to near hard 
freeze levels. Cannot rule out a freeze in northern Lea County 
either and this will have to be monitored for possible inclusion in 
the watch later.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Saturday)
Issued at 246 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Long term pattern will be dominated by multiple cases of western US 
trough amplification as multiple shortwaves dig from the PAC NW down 
through the Rockies, and eventually the plains. Our previous 
disturbance will eject eastward across the Mississippi Valley with 
some chilly air in its wake. Lows Tuesday morning will be in the 30s 
and 40s for much of the forecast area with even some freezing 
temperatures increasingly likely across the Marfa Plateau and 
adjacent high terrain. Northern Lea county will be borderline, but 
will be a zone to bear watching in case a freeze product is 
necessary. Temperatures will rebound on Tuesday back into the 60s 
and 70s thanks to a return to prevailing southwest flow as the low 
pressure shoves eastward. 

A moderating temp pattern will occur mid-week with widespread 70s 
once again forecast across the region, but another digging shortwave 
trough is forecast to enter the confines of W TX with lower heights 
and modest ascent that could trigger a round of showers/storms for 
our northern and eastern areas Thursday night into Friday. 
Disturbance will be a fast mover with eyes on the Mississippi Valley 
by the following weekend, so the time frame for precip will be short-
lived. However, another dip in regional temperatures expected for 
the end of the week behind the vacating disturbance. 

The pattern will continue to be active with mean troughing in the 
western US with progressive nature of shortwaves driving the nature 
of the long term pattern. This is a prime case where sometime down 
the line there could be a stronger push of cooler air into the 
region. Nothing on the immediate horizon, but some hints of more 
deep fall airmasses are possible near the end of October into early 
November. It will be something we'll keep tabs on, but until then, 
we'll see an undulation of temperature forecasts.

(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1213 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Current satellite shows wave clouds forming in the lee of the
Guadalupe Mountains near CNM indicating turbulence and the
potential for gusty winds to mix to the surface as noted at ATS.
Other locations will be gusty but speeds will be lower. Winds
relax slightly tonight before increasing from the west again after
12Z tomorrow. Light showers are possible 06-15Z but confidence is
decreasing and have left out for now. VFR conditions should
continue.
