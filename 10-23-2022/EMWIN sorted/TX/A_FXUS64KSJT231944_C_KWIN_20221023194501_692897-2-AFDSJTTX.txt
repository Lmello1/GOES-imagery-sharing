Issued at 227 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Breezy to windy today as the lee trough along the Texas and New
Mexico state line develops today. South wind of 20 to 30 mph will
gust to 35 mph in the Big Country with 15 to 25 mph and gusts to
30 mph farther south. 

Temperatures will be a couple degrees cooler today with increasing
cloudiness late afternoon, with approach of a strong upper level
trough. Shower and thunderstorms develop after 1 AM tonight, with
lift from the upper system and increasing moisture. The Big 
Country and portions of the Concho Valley are in a marginal risk 
of severe storms toward daybreak Monday, with a potential squall 
line. Main hazards are wind damage and hail.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday night through next Saturday)
Issued at 207 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Upper level low tracks across the Red River Valley Monday night.
Models continue to indicate some wrap around precipitation mainly
across northern portions of the Big Country as the low tracks off
to the east. Will carry the highest PoPs north of the I-20
corridor. Otherwise, overnight lows will drop down into the 40s.
It will breezy in the overnight hours as the aforementioned upper
low moves off to the northeast of the region. Dry conditions are
then expected mid week as shortwave ridging builds overhead. Highs
will be in the lower to mid 70s on Tuesday and then warm into the
upper 70s and lower 80s for Wednesday and Thursday. The coldest
morning will be on Wednesday as decent radiational cooling
conditions set up. Lows will drop down into the lower to mid 40s,
with some 30s possible across the typical cold spots and valleys.  

Rain chances return for the end of the work week as another upper
level system ejects out of the Four Corners and moves eastward
across west Texas on Friday. Still some timing differences
between the global models (GFS more progressive vs the slower and
slightly deeper ECWMF). Will continue to stick with the model
blend which has the highest rain chances Thursday night and into
Friday morning. The upper low quickly tracks off to the east
leaving dry and pleasant conditions in place for the weekend.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1206 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Satellite shows that low clouds have largely eroded from the
southern terminals early this afternoon and should leave VFR
conditions for the afternoon and likely he evening hours. Gusty
south winds will also continued, gusting over 35kts at times.
Models continue to show a few mid level showers near the
KSOA/KJCT/KBBD locations this evening, and then a much better
chance of much more widespread and significant shower and
thunderstorm activity developing around sunrise Monday morning and
continuing through at least mid morning. Have accounted for some
of this in the package but will likely fine-tune the timing as we
get through the evening hours.
