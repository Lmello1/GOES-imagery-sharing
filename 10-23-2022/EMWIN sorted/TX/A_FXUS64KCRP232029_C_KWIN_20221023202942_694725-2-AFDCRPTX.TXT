.SHORT TERM...
(Tonight through Monday night)
Issued at 259 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Winds have definitely been kicking across South Texas today. Gusts
have been reaching around 34 knots across the area. We will see a
brief break in the higher gusts tonight before the winds pick back
up ahead of an approaching cold front tomorrow.

As the cold front approaches Monday afternoon/night, showers and
thunderstorms are expected to develop. A few showers and storms
could be strong to severe. SPC has included most of our area in a
Slight Risk for severe weather. Expect gusty winds and maybe large
hail. Though unlikely, an isolated tornado can not be ruled out.
Winds will shift behind the front Monday night becoming
northwest to northerly. While chances for precipitation are 
fairly high (50-80% in some areas), rainfall totals do not look 
like they will amount to much. Even so, we can't rule out isolated
heavy rainfall in any of the stronger showers or storms. 

Our rip current risk has been updated through Monday night to a
HIGH risk. Wave heights and strong winds could lead to increased
chances for rip currents. If you choose to go in the water, please
use extreme caution.

Minor coastal flooding may also be a concern, especially near high
tide, with elevated seas and strong onshore flow. In our favor,
the winds have remained generally southerly; however, should this
become more easterly, water levels could reach the dunes. This is
something we will be monitoring through Monday night when the
frontal passage should help to reduce the chances for minor
coastal flooding.

Temperatures will remain warm under mostly cloudy skies tonight
with highs for Monday ranging from the low 80s along the coast to
the low 90s across the Brush Country. Temperatures will drop
slowly behind the cold front Tuesday night, with lows expected to
dip into the upper 50s and low 60s across much of South Texas.

.LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through next Saturday)
Issued at 259 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

The beginning of the Extended period will be much different from the 
short-term with much drier, cooler and breezy conditions developing 
across South Texas on Tuesday in the wake of the early morning cold 
front. Highs on Tuesday will be running around 10 degrees cooler 
than Monday and in the upper 70s to lower 80s, with overnight lows 
ranging from the upper 40s inland to the mid to upper 50s along the 
coast. Wednesday should generally be dry, but a few degrees warmer. 
By Wednesday night, onshore flow returns to the area with moisture 
gradually increasing over the region. 

A few showers and thunderstorms (PoPs around 20-30%) will be 
possible Thursday afternoon inland as a result of deeper moisture 
being ushered in from the Gulf by the return flow. Rain/storm 
chances are progged to increase Thursday night into Friday as the 
next mid to upper level trough swings across the Southern Plains 
pushing through another cold front into the region. The highest rain 
chances can be expected across the eastern half of the CWA Friday 
morning with PoPs rising to around 40-60%, with limited activity 
expected out west (PoPs less than a 20%). There is still some 
uncertainty in regards to the timing of this next frontal passage, 
with models diverging, and indicating the cooler air may not arrive 
until Saturday. With these discrepancies in mind, have opted on 
siding with the output from the NBM for now, which aligns better 
with the current FROPA timing indicated by the GFS. Highs will 
remain around near normal values for the season through the week, 
running slightly below normal by the end of the week and into next 
weekend behind the frontal boundary.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1153 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

We'll see more clouds than we have in the last few days as
moisture streams into the area. Conditions will remain VFR through
today and most of tonight, though ceilings will begin to lower by
around 06Z for most sites. Isolated showers are possible today for
CRP and VCT though chances are low enough that there is no mention
in the TAFs. MVFR ceilings are expected by 12Z across South Texas
as more moisture and an upper level disturbance push across the
area. Chances for showers will increase Monday afternoon. South to
southeasterly winds will be strong, with gusts to around 30 knots.
General aviation interests should use caution.

.MARINE...
Issued at 259 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

A Small Craft Advisory is in effect though Tuesday afternoon. 
Increasing moisture combined with an upper level disturbance will 
contribute to isolated showers and thunderstorms today, with 
coverage increasing to scattered Monday night as a cold front 
sweeps across the area. Strong onshore flow tonight through 
Monday will become strong offshore flow behind the cold front 
Monday night. Rain chances will gradually taper off across the 
coastal waters Tuesday morning. A strong offshore flow Tuesday 
morning will be weakening to more moderate levels Tuesday 
afternoon into the evening hours. A generally weak to moderate 
offshore flow will persist on Wednesday before becoming onshore 
Wednesday night. Winds will increase to strong levels once again 
late in the week ahead of another cold front. Isolated to 
scattered showers and thunderstorms will also accompany this next 
system late in the week
