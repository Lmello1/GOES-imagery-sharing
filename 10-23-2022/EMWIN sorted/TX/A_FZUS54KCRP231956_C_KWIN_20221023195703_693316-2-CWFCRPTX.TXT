.SYNOPSIS FOR THE MIDDLE TEXAS COASTAL WATERS...
A Small Craft Advisory is in effect though Tuesday afternoon. 
Increasing moisture combined with an upper level disturbance will 
contribute to isolated showers and thunderstorms today, with 
coverage increasing to scattered Monday night as a cold front 
sweeps across the area. Strong onshore flow tonight through 
Monday will become strong offshore flow behind the cold front 
Monday night. Rain chances will gradually taper off across the 
coastal waters Tuesday morning. A strong offshore flow Tuesday 
morning will be weakening to more moderate levels Tuesday 
afternoon into the evening hours. A generally weak to moderate 
offshore flow will persist on Wednesday before becoming onshore 
Wednesday night. Winds will increase to strong levels once again 
late in the week ahead of another cold front. Isolated to 
scattered showers and thunderstorms will also accompany this next 
system late in the week.
