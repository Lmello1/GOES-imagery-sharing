...Potential for Virga Triggered Downbursts...

Weak RADAR echoes indicating the formation of virga showers aloft
have begun to develop across the northern South Plains and
southwestern Texas Panhandle. With a very dry airmass beneath the
cloud layer, there is an enhanced risk of strong downburst
activity beneath any virga showers that exist. Localized, short
duration wind gusts to 50 mph appear probable with the possibility
of a few gusts above 60 mph.
