.SHORT TERM... /NEW/
/Through Sunrise Tuesday/

Bottom Line: Monday's early morning rain will give way to 
scattered thunderstorm activity through the afternoon. There will 
be a threat for strong to severe storms mainly across Central
Texas, with damaging winds the primary concern. Hail and a few 
tornadoes cannot be ruled out. Heavy rain may also lead to
isolated flooding if training of thunderstorms occurs. 

A potent series of shortwaves is inching closer to North and 
Central Texas as a powerful trough digs southeastward across the 
Four Corners region. The first shortwave that will impact the 
region will be the remnants of Tropical Storm Roslyn, currently 
bringing torrential rainfall to the mountainous terrain of central
Mexico. Forcing for ascent and moisture will gradually increase 
after midnight, leading to the development of isolated to 
scattered rain showers through sunrise Monday. As the remnants of 
Roslyn skirt our region, another shortwave will arrive from the 
west, ushering much stronger forcing for ascent. Thunderstorm 
activity should blossom just west of our region by mid-morning, 
forming a cluster of convection as it marches eastward through the
early afternoon hours. Slight linear organization cannot be ruled
out with a threat for strong winds. Slightly more isolated 
convection may develop across Central Texas, where instability is 
likely to be slightly higher. This area will need to be monitored 
for any overzealous rotating updrafts capable of hail and damaging
winds. In addition to the convective threats, there is a chance 
that thunderstorm training leads to isolated flash flooding across
eastern portions of North and Central Texas. Remain vigilant if 
heavy rain affects your vicinity over an extended period of time.

The next source of strong lift will be the incoming front 
expected to arrive around sunset across our western counties, 
then progress eastward through the night. Given a fairly worked-
over atmosphere, it becomes difficult to predict just how much 
recovery will take place in the wake of the afternoon convection 
and the arrival of the front. With guidance suggesting slightly 
more scarce convection across Central Texas earlier in the day, 
probability of strong to severe storms will remain highest in that
area although it cannot be discounted further north into eastern 
North Texas. Storms along the cold front will pose mainly a strong
to damaging wind threat. Given the presence of appreciable 0-3km 
shear orthogonal/nearly orthogonal to the expected linear complex,
a quick QLCS tornado or two cannot be ruled out during the 
evening hours tomorrow. 

Breezy westerly winds will follow behind the front, continuing 
through the night. As the main upper level low moves overhead, 
wrap around moisture may be sufficient for additional showers and 
isolated storms to continue along the Red River through sunrise 
Tuesday. We'll have to monitor the threat for small hail with any 
early morning convection on Tuesday given lapse rates may approach
7.5 C/km along the Red River.

.LONG TERM... /Issued 350 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022/
/Tuesday through next Weekend/

Precipitation will come to an end Tuesday morning as the storm 
system moves towards the Mississippi Valley. Only a few lingering
showers are possible across the far northern counties. Cooler 
temperatures and clearing conditions are expected with highs 
staying in the 60s to low 70s. Surface winds will remain 
breezy/windy out of the north at around 15-20 mph gusting to 25-30
mph. Winds will diminish during the evening hours becoming light 
and variable overnight. Clear skies and light winds will result in
overnight lows in the 40s.

A gradual warming trend is expected Wednesday and Thursday as the
the upper flow becomes more zonal and southerly winds return. 
Daytime highs will generally stay in the 70s and morning lows in 
the 40s and 50s. The dry period will be short-lived as the next 
storm system is forecast to arrive on Friday, also bringing 
another cooldown to the region. Uncertainty remains high on the 
progression of the next system which is expected this far out in
time. For now, the forecast shows a chance of showers/storms 
Thursday night through Friday night, but there's a potential that 
precipitation may linger into Saturday. Near to below normal 
temperatures will persist into the weekend.

.AVIATION... /NEW/
/18Z TAFs/

Concerns... 
Today: Gusty southerly winds continue. 
Tonight: MVFR moves in with continued windy conditions. 
Tomorrow: Rain develops in the AM; storm chances increase by late
morning through the afternoon. MVFR through the end of the TAF 
cycle. 

Windy conditions will continue through the rest of today as 
speeds remain in the 15-20 mph range with gusts between 30-35 mph.
Given the southerly direction, crosswind concerns remain minimal 
for much of the region. 

As we move into tonight, weather conditions will be changing as
moisture increases through the region and a shroud of stratus 
invades from the south. MVFR is expected to cover the region 
around midnight, with a gradual development of rain showers mainly
along and west of I-35. As a weather system approaches the 
region, we'll see an uptick in thunderstorm development, initially
across areas west of the D10 airspace. By mid-morning, the threat
for widespread shower and thunderstorm activity increases as one 
system moves overhead. At this time, the main window for 
thunderstorm activity remains between 15-20Z with variable and 
erratic winds expected as the storms moves through. Expect 
additional refinements to the TAF as models converge on a more 
specific timing for storm impacts. Wind direction in the wake of 
the afternoon convection is likely to remain variable given the 
cold front still well to the west of our region. Given that is 
beyond this forecast cycle, expect wind direction refinements to 
be made through the next 24 hours.
