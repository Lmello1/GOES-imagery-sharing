.SHORT TERM...
(This evening through Monday)
Issued at 245 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

A breezy and warm fall day across West Central texas with 
temperatures climbing into the low to mid 80s areawide. This all 
ahead of a couple of shortwaves set to rotate across the area 
tonight and bring a chance of showers and storms, with a stronger 
upper low following on Monday afternoon.

First wave ripples across mainly the southern and southeastern areas 
this evening, with many models showing at lease some light to 
moderate showers developing from Sonora to Brady and then eventually 
much of the Hill Country and Heartland after midnight. Second 
stronger shortwave approaches towards sunrise, with fairly 
widespread convection developing and continuing through mid to late 
morning. Decent dynamics aloft means that a few of these storms may 
become strong. This wave pushes through and may see some sun by 
afternoon, along with a little downslope flow that may boost 
temperatures a few degrees.

Finally, the upper low begins to approach the western Big Country by 
00Z Monday afternoon. Good lift still ongoing ahead of this system, 
although surface winds likely pretty hard west and driving low level 
moisture to the east. Models seem to underdo these strong upper lows 
that have little low level moisture, but good mid level moisture. 
Will continue to carry some PoPs ahead of this system through the 
afternoon.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday night through next Saturday)
Issued at 207 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Upper level low tracks across the Red River Valley Monday night.
Models continue to indicate some wrap around precipitation mainly
across northern portions of the Big Country as the low tracks off
to the east. Will carry the highest PoPs north of the I-20
corridor. Otherwise, overnight lows will drop down into the 40s.
It will breezy in the overnight hours as the aforementioned upper
low moves off to the northeast of the region. Dry conditions are
then expected mid week as shortwave ridging builds overhead. Highs
will be in the lower to mid 70s on Tuesday and then warm into the
upper 70s and lower 80s for Wednesday and Thursday. The coldest
morning will be on Wednesday as decent radiational cooling
conditions set up. Lows will drop down into the lower to mid 40s,
with some 30s possible across the typical cold spots and valleys.  

Rain chances return for the end of the work week as another upper
level system ejects out of the Four Corners and moves eastward
across west Texas on Friday. Still some timing differences
between the global models (GFS more progressive vs the slower and
slightly deeper ECWMF). Will continue to stick with the model
blend which has the highest rain chances Thursday night and into
Friday morning. The upper low quickly tracks off to the east
leaving dry and pleasant conditions in place for the weekend.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1206 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Satellite shows that low clouds have largely eroded from the
southern terminals early this afternoon and should leave VFR
conditions for the afternoon and likely he evening hours. Gusty
south winds will also continued, gusting over 35kts at times.
Models continue to show a few mid level showers near the
KSOA/KJCT/KBBD locations this evening, and then a much better
chance of much more widespread and significant shower and
thunderstorm activity developing around sunrise Monday morning and
continuing through at least mid morning. Have accounted for some
of this in the package but will likely fine-tune the timing as we
get through the evening hours.
