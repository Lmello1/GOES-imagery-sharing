.SHORT TERM...
(Now through Monday)
Issued at 338 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

The pressure gradient along the lower Texas coast tightens into 
Monday as a ridge of high pressure along the East Coast builds and 
low pressure across the Rockies and Plains deepens. This will 
increase southeasterly winds, especially along the coast and lower 
RGV, helping warm temperatures both today and Monday to above normal 
highs in the 90s. Expect windy conditions along the coast and mid to 
lower RGV both afternoons and early evenings, with wind gusts each 
afternoon potentially reaching 35 to 40 mph. A brief Wind Advisory 
may be needed, especially on Monday. 

Major Hurricane Roslyn is expected to make landfall along the west-
central coast of Mexico today, and lose steam as it runs into the 
higher terrain of Northern Mexico. The cyclone has strengthened to a 
category 4 hurricane, and may try to bring some light rainfall to 
the brush country or upper valley late tonight as the mid-level 
remnants run east toward the border. Have left POPs below 20 
percent. A few streamer showers are possible, mainly offshore, 
tonight through Monday.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday night through Saturday)
Issued at 338 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

The forecast period starts with a 500mb trough over the Plains with 
the associated cold front across central Texas. Moisture will 
continue to pool along and ahead of the front with precipitable 
waters (PWATs) of around 2 inches, especially across the eastern 
portions of the CWA. The cold front is expected to approach the 
region late Monday evening and push through all of Deep South Texas 
early Tuesday morning. Scattered to numerous showers and isolated 
thunderstorms are expected Monday night into Tuesday morning as 
moisture and lift increases along and ahead of the front. Rain 
chances will then quickly end from west to east through late Tuesday 
morning as the mid-level trough axis moves farther eastward and 
surface high pressure builds into the region. Breezy north winds, 
especially near the coast, will develop in the wake of the front on 
Tuesday. Much drier air filters into the region on Tuesday with 
dewpoints falling into the upper 30s to the 40s by late Tuesday 
morning into the afternoon. 

With Relative Humidity values expected to be in the low to mid 20s 
generally along and west of I-69E corridor and sustained winds of 
about 20 mph behind the front, fire weather could be an issue. 
However, rainfall associated with this system may limit fire weather 
concerns. Will need to continue to monitor fire weather conditions 
for Tuesday.

Otherwise, a nearly zonal 500mb flow will prevail Tuesday night into 
Friday with generally rain-free conditions expected across the area 
through Wednesday night. Rain chances return Thursday into Thursday 
night, mainly near the coast, as Gulf moisture surges back into 
area. Another mid-level trough axis swings eastward over the Plains 
and drags a weak cold front into the region on Friday. Isolated to 
scattered showers and thunderstorms are possible on Friday with the 
approach and passage of the front. 

slightly below normal are expected Tuesday and Wednesday before 
temperatures warm back up by late in the week as southerly flow 
returns. Daytime highs in the low to mid 80s and overnight lows in 
the 60s are expected Tuesday through Friday. Temperatures fall back 
to near to slightly below normal by weekend in the wake of the next 
front.

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1233 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

VFR conditions will persist through the TAF period. Winds will be
southeasterly and will continue to be windy during the period.
Wind gusts could get up to 30 to 35 kts through the rest of the
afternoon and again on Monday afternoon.

.MARINE...
Issued at 338 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Now through Monday...Small Craft Advisories are in effect into 
Monday morning, and will eventually be extended into the long term 
period for the Gulf of Mexico waters. A Small Craft Advisory for the 
Laguna Madre will be in effect from 11 AM this morning into Monday 
morning, and likely need to be extended as well. The pressure 
gradient keeps elevated southeasterly winds through Monday, gusting 
at times each afternoon to 30 kts. A few streamer showers are 
possible offshore, mainly tonight through Monday, with a better 
chance of showers and thunderstorms increasing from the north late 
Monday. 

Monday night through Friday...Moderate to strong southerly winds are
expected along the lower Texas coast Monday evening ahead of a cold 
front. Strong north winds will develop late Monday night into 
Tuesday morning with the passage of a cold front. Ongoing Small 
Craft Advisory will likely continue Monday night into Tuesday. 
Conditions will improve Tuesday night through much of the period 
as high pressure builds then settles across the region. Scattered 
to numerous showers and isolated thunderstorms are possible Monday
night and Tuesday as a cold front approaches and then moves 
through the waters. Moderate onshore flow and building seas 
develop by late next week as another front approaches the region.
