.SHORT TERM...
(Today and tonight)
Issued at 227 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Breezy to windy today as the lee trough along the Texas and New
Mexico state line develops today. South wind of 20 to 30 mph will
gust to 35 mph in the Big Country with 15 to 25 mph and gusts to
30 mph farther south. 

Temperatures will be a couple degrees cooler today with increasing
cloudiness late afternoon, with approach of a strong upper level
trough. Shower and thunderstorms develop after 1 AM tonight, with
lift from the upper system and increasing moisture. The Big 
Country and portions of the Concho Valley are in a marginal risk 
of severe storms toward daybreak Monday, with a potential squall 
line. Main hazards are wind damage and hail.

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Saturday)
Issued at 309 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Moist southerly flow will continue to filter into west central
Texas for the start of the work week, along with an approaching
upper-level shortwave and pacific front that will likely bring
some showers and thunderstorms into the region through Tuesday. 
This continues to look like a quick moving system, therefor we 
expect lower rainfall amounts and not much in the way of flooding 
issues at this time. The highest rainfall amounts will generally 
be across our northern and eastern counties where totals of half 
an inch to possibly up to an inch are possible. Rain chances will 
decrease in the afternoon as the shortwave exits off to the east. 
Highs on Monday will be tricky depending on how much clearing we 
see in the afternoon. Otherwise, expect breezy conditions to 
develop Monday afternoon and continue into Tuesday. Tuesday 
through Thursday will be sunny and dry, with highs in the 70s and 
80s. The next upper level system approaches from the west on 
Friday, still showing some timing differences between the GFS and
ECMWF, so we continued to carry lower confidence in precipitation
in the forecast for now.

(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1206 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Satellite shows that low clouds have largely eroded from the
southern terminals early this afternoon and should leave VFR
conditions for the afternoon and likely he evening hours. Gusty
south winds will also continued, gusting over 35kts at times.
Models continue to show a few mid level showers near the
KSOA/KJCT/KBBD locations this evening, and then a much better
chance of much more widespread and significant shower and
thunderstorm activity developing around sunrise Monday morning and
continuing through at least mid morning. Have accounted for some
of this in the package but will likely fine-tune the timing as we
get through the evening hours.
