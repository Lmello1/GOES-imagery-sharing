AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
National Weather Service Charleston WV
156 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

.SYNOPSIS...
Above normal temperatures on tap through Tuesday. The next 
frontal system should arrive by the middle of the week bringing
the area some rain potential and cooler temperatures.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH MONDAY/...
As of 100 PM Sunday...

A high pressure system will remain along or just east of the
mountains tonight and Monday. This will provide dry weather 
with a light southerly to southeasterly wind flow during the
daytime, but calm winds in the east at night.

&&

.SHORT TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...
As of 155 PM Sunday...

Mild and dry conditions continue through Tuesday evening as 
transient ridging continues to build ahead of deep longwave 
troughing across the west. This will lead to lee side cyclogenesis 
in the lee of the Southern Rockies during the day Monday.

Tuesday will be the warmest day of the week as H500 heights approach 
585dm. Despite highs near 80 degrees over the lowlands, 10+ degrees 
above normal values for this time of the year, do not see any real 
challenge to daily temperature records (records are generally in the 
mid 80s across the lower elevations). While winds will be relatively 
light, recent dry conditions coupled with unseasonably warm 
temperatures, dew points in the mid 40s, and ample fine dead fuels 
in the form of fallen leaves may lead to an elevated fire danger on 
Tuesday.

Low pressure deepening in the Texas Panhandle will continue to 
progress into the Lower Mississippi Valley Tuesday and into the 
Lower Ohio Valley Tuesday night before moving into the Middle Ohio 
Valley early Wednesday morning. This will yield a period of rain 
during the Wednesday for most locations in the forecast area with 
generally light accumulations of around a quarter inch with some 
localized higher amounts. This feature then opens into a wave and 
ejects into the Lower Great Lakes Wednesday night bringing 
precipitation to an end.

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
As of 155 PM Saturday...

Precipitation comes to an end Wednesday night into Thursday
morning as low pressure departs to the northeast. Models begin 
to diverge significantly regarding handling of the next wave 
developing into the lee side low across the Southern Rockies 
which could bring the next round of precipitation as early as 
Saturday night or as late as Sunday night. Narrowed down fairly 
wide tail of the ensemble distribution advertised by NBM and 
kept Saturday mainly dry for now with precipitation arriving 
Saturday night.

Daytime highs remain near normal values for this time of the year 
with overnight lows slightly above normal, generally in the mid 40s, 
across the lower elevations. Overnight lows from now through
next weekend remain generally above freezing aside from some
potential colder pockets in well protected mountain valleys
Friday morning.

the period.
