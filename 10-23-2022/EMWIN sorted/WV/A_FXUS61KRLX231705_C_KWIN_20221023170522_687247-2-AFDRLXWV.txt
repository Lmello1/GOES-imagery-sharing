AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
National Weather Service Charleston WV
105 PM EDT Sun Oct 23 2022

.SYNOPSIS...
Above normal temperatures on tap through Tuesday. The next 
frontal system should arrive by the middle of the week bringing
the area some rain potential and cooler temperatures.

&&

.NEAR TERM /THROUGH MONDAY/...
As of 100 PM Sunday...

A high pressure system will remain along or just east of the
mountains tonight and Monday. This will provide dry weather 
with a light southerly to southeasterly wind flow during the
daytime, but calm winds in the east at night. 

&&

.SHORT TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...
As of 245 AM Sunday...

The warming trend continues through Tuesday with anomalously
higher temperatures than average for this time of year. A 
surface low is then forecast to take a northeasterly track and 
head directly across the area. This will spread precipitation 
in the form of rain from west to east as early as Tuesday 
evening. Models have come together on timing and orientation 
where central guidance seemed fairly reasonable with brining 
probabilities of precipitation in, however long range models 
seem to have slowed down progression slightly, therefore capped
off any mention of precipitation until Tuesday evening. Any 
rain associated with this system will likely taper off by late 
Wednesday afternoon. Some lingering showers are possible into 
the evening directly confined to the northeast mountains. Was 
not thinking a whole lot of QPF with this system and WPC has 
confirmed this with about a quarter of an inch or less across 
the entire area for the duration of this event. Thereafter, 
temperatures cool down some dropping to around seasonable as 
southerly flow turns northwesterly upon the exit the the 
aforementioned system.

&&

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
As of 205 PM Saturday...

Temperatures actually fall to the climatological norm during
this time frame, maybe a few degrees below, and continue over 
the entire period. The next chance for any precipitation, which
will be in the form of rain, will be sometime Friday evening. 
Central guidance wanted to bring mention of rain early Friday, 
but models do not have anything in the vicinity of the area for 
the first half of the weekend. For that reason, delayed chances 
for precipitation slightly from what guidance suggested. Models 
really dont spin anything up until the end of the weekend, 
however guidance did keep mention of chances through the entire 
weekend. Since model inconsistency is apparent decided to accept
guidance in hopes that ensemble solutions may have a better 
handle on the weekend than the long range models.
