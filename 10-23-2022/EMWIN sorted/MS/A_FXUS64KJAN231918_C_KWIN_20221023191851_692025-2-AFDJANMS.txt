.DISCUSSION...
Issued at 216 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Through Monday:

Today is unfolding similarly to yesterday. A low level CU field 
has developed mainly west of I-55, while warm southerly winds are 
gusty at times due to a tight pressure gradient between a 
developing system over the High Plains and an East Coast ridge. 
While the cu field will diminish this evening, areas of low 
stratus clouds may spread into the area overnight as moisture 
advection increases ahead of the next storm system. Though no PoP 
was included in the forecast, it's within the realm of possibility
a few sprinkles may accompany those low clouds tomorrow morning 
across south MS. The daytime hours Monday will be similarly warm 
and breezy, though greater cloud cover is anticipated. Wind gusts 
to around 30 mph will be possible at times, not quite enough to 
advertise as a hazard. /DL/

Tuesday through Sunday:

There is a Slight Risk for severe thunderstorms early Tuesday 
morning into Tuesday afternoon as a cold front moves through the 
region. A low pressure system quickly pivoting from the Southern 
High Plains across AR and northern MS will drive mid-level height 
falls and increasing southerly flow in the lower levels into the 
daytime. Dew points along and just ahead of the approaching cold 
front should surge into the mid- to upper-60s, while forcing helps 
mix the lower-levels and allow for potential convection to tap into 
around 100-300 J/kg of MLCAPE early in the morning. Deep-layer wind 
shear on the order of around 50-60 kts is more than enough to 
support some supercellular organization to storms that develop, but 
instability may be too weak to keep individual updrafts sustained 
for long. Localized damaging wind gusts and an isolated tornado will 
be possible at least initially. As the squall line progresses 
eastward, model guidance indicates daytime heating and continued 
moistening of the low levels should boost instability with around 
700-1000 J/kg of MLCAPE ahead of the line when it reaches central to 
eastern MS in the early afternoon. This would provide a better 
balance for sustained updrafts and a better chance for some severe 
thunderstorms to develop. The threat for severe storms should 
quickly end from west to east through the afternoon in the wake of 
the front. Strong winds from the west will continue behind the front 
however, as a deeply mixed air mass with steep low-level lapse rates 
helps tight gradient winds mix to the surface. For now, have left 
this gradient wind threat out of the HWO text or graphics so as to 
not confuse messaging about the initial severe weather threat.

A briefly cooler and drier few days are expected under zonal flow 
aloft through midweek, but then the next shortwave trough looks to 
arrive late in the week and develop a low centered closer to the 
Gulf Coast as it slides through. While confidence in the details of 
southern stream low pressure systems this far out is hard to come by 
in the cool season, the consensus of the deterministic models 
indicates we may stay more on the cooler northern side of the 
surface low during the late week/weekend time frame. This suggests 
cloudier and cooler weather with some rain and drizzle, with less of 
a chance for thunderstorms. We'll continue to monitor trends in the 
guidance and update the forecast as this next system approaches. /NF/

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1247 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

VFR conditions will prevail through the TAF period. Southerly
winds will be gusty at times, especially this afternoon and again
during the daytime hours west of a HEZ/JAN/GTR line. Patchy fog
cannot be ruled out around PIB/HBG Mon morning, but confidence is
too low to include in TAF at this time. /DL/
