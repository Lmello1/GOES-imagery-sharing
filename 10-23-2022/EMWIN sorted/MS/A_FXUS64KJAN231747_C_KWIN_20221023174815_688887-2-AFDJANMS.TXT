.MESOSCALE UPDATE...
Issued at 936 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Another relatively quiet weather day is underway across the area.
Much like yesterday, the only item of note is gusty wind, 
especially farther north and west in the area where the surface 
pressure gradient is a bit tighter. We've already seen a few wind 
gusts over 20 mph this morning and expect that to become more 
common over a larger area through the day. Otherwise, high temps 
were tweaked upward a degree or two in a few areas where higher 
readings were achieved yesterday and there's little reason to 
suspect they won't do the same today. /DL/

.DISCUSSION...
Issued at 333 AM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

Today and tonight...Surface and upper ridging will prevail across 
the ArkLaMiss today, with mostly clear skies and highs ranging from 
the upper 70s east to low 80s in the west. The winds will be breezy 
out of the south across the Delta, with a few gusts from 20-25 mph 
this afternoon. Little will change tonight, with lows ranging from 
around 50 in the east to the low 60s in the west. /15/

Monday into next weekend...

Upper ridging will continue to build across the region to start the 
week, which will give us temperatures in the upper 70s and lower 80s 
for Monday. As this occurs, a trough will dig south across the 
Desert Southwest. Through the beginning of the week, this trough 
will swing east across our region. Ahead of it, a line of showers 
and thunderstorms will develop along or ahead of an approaching cold 
front. By Monday night, an area of low pressure at the surface will 
develop and begin to intensify across Arkansas. Models continue to 
be in good agreement of the overall synoptic setup. Ahead of this 
front, the ArkLaMiss region will be under southerly return flow. 
This will help bring moisture back into the region that has been 
rather moisture starved for the last few weeks. Dewpoints are 
forecast to return to the mid and upper 60s Monday night(with lower 
60s in the far northeast). Precipitable water values of around three 
quarters of an inch currently will increase to around 1.5-1.7 inches 
by Monday night. This is thanks to good moisture transport ahead of 
the cold front, and an increase in the 850mb winds to around 30-
40kts Monday night. There will be plenty of wind associated with 
this system, both with the line of storms and potentially outside of 
it. Low level shear will be around 30kts and deeper shear of around 
45-50kts across the region on Tuesday, which will also help enhance 
helicity values to around 300 m2/s2. The biggest question will be 
how much instability will be present for these storms to truly tap 
into. They will be coming through the region during the day, which 
will help provide better instability, but overall forecast values 
are on the lower end. They do increase during the day, to around 600-
1000 J/kg. Given more than sufficient wind energy, will continue to 
mention potential for severe thunderstorms during the day on 
Tuesday. Primary concern will be from damaging winds and tornadoes. 
Much of the area is in a slight risk and some alteration to the 
current outlooked area will be needed. The question as to how far 
east/southeast will the severe potential be lies in how much 
instability we can get, but at this point, the best forcing will be 
pulling away to the north and east of the region.  Given the fast 
moving nature of this system, rainfall amounts look in check with 
overall forecast QPF of around 0.60 inches in the north to around 
0.15 inches in the Pine Belt. 

The storms and associated front will move through the region by 
Tuesday night, resulting in a drop of temperatures into the upper 
40s overnight. Slightly cooler highs in the 70s will occur for late 
in the week before some moderation begins heading into the weekend. 
Another quick moving weather system looks to move through for next 
Friday evening into Saturday, but right now there remains a wide 
spread in terms of timing, intensity and placement of the path of 
the low. For now, will continue with lower chances of rain Friday 
going into Saturday. /28/

.AVIATION...
(18Z TAFS)
Issued at 1247 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

VFR conditions will prevail through the TAF period. Southerly
winds will be gusty at times, especially this afternoon and again
during the daytime hours west of a HEZ/JAN/GTR line. Patchy fog
cannot be ruled out around PIB/HBG Mon morning, but confidence is
too low to include in TAF at this time. /DL/
