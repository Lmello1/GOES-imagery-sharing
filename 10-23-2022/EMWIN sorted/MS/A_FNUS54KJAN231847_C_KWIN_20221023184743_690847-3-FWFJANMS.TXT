147 PM CDT Sun Oct 23 2022

.DISCUSSION...Warm and breezy conditions will continue into Monday
ahead of the next storm system. Showers and thunderstorms will
return Monday night into Tuesday as the cold front pushes across
the region, with dry weather returning on Wednesday. RHs will
remain above critical thresholds through Tuesday. Patchy fog can't
be ruled out early Monday morning over southeast Mississippi, but
no widespread fog development is expected due to a persisting
southerly breeze.
