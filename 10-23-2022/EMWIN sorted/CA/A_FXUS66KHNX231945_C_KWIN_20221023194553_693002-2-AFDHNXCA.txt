week. There is a chance of precipitation in the Sierra Nevada on
Wednesday but mostly will be a wind event.

.DISCUSSION...
We woke up to colder temperatures today thanks to a 
trough that is still sliding southeast. This trough has brought a 
shift of colder air being advected aloft into our area from the 
Pacific Northwest. Both GEFS and European Model Ensembles are in 
agreement of a consistent northwesterly flow aloft until Friday
when we have a small ridge over California. Both ensembles also 
are in agreement of a trough that will slide in on Wednesday to 
the north of us before sliding to our east. This trough is 
currently looking like it will bring mostly wind on Wednesday with
a slight chance of precipitation mostly in the Sierra Nevada. The
probabilistic models show chances in the teens of rain in the 
Central Valley for Wednesday. 

The high temperatures for the next week are going to be at or below 
the average of the mid to upper 70s for the Central Valley. Latest 
probabilistic models show that Tuesday will have the highest 
chances of temperatures of at least 80 degrees. However, those 
chances on Tuesday are mostly between 15 and 30 percent chance. 
The probabilistic models show the chances of overnight lows to be 
below 40 degrees to be under 20 percent every day this week.
