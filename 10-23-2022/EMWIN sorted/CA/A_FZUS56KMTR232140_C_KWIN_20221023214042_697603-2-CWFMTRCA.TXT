.Synopsis for the Central California Coast and Bays Including 
the Monterey Bay...Greater Farallones...and Cordell Bank 
National Marine Sanctuaries...

Strong north-northwest winds continue with gale force gusts over 
the outer waters. Waves remain high and potentially steep at 9 to
12 feet. This is in addition to background swells from the 
northwest and south at around 12 to 13 seconds and 16 to 18 
seconds respectively. Inexperienced mariners and small craft 
operators should remain in port or seek shelter until seas 
diminish overnight. Monday and Tuesday will have calmer seas but 
with some breezy winds, especially at the coastal jets and gaps.
