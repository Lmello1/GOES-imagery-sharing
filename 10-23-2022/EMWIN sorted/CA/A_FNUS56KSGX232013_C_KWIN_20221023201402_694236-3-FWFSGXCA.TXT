A period of gusty Santa Ana winds will impact the San Bernardino
Mountains, portions of the Inland Empire, the Santa Ana Mountains
and canyons, and areas near and below the San Gorgonio Pass, from
late evening through midday on Monday. Relative humidity will 
fall considerably as well, and could set up a few hours of 
elevated fire weather conditions in these areas. The wind will
weaken rapidly Monday afternoon, allowing a good recovery in
relative humidity overnight into Tuesday. Except for coastal areas
on Monday, daytime temperatures are expected to remain near or below
average all week, with no precipitation
