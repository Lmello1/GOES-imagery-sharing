Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service San Francisco Bay Area
1145 AM PDT Sun Oct 23 2022

.SYNOPSIS...Lingering hazardous marine and beach conditions today
with gusty winds, steep seas and strong currents. A Frost Advisory
has been issued for 11 pm tonight to 9 am PDT Monday morning for
much of the Bay Area and north Central Coast mainly excluding
urban areas such as San Francisco and along the San Francisco Bay
Shoreline. Colder temperatures developing tonight and early Monday
morning as drier air continues to advance over our forecast area 
coupled to light winds and clear sky through sunrise Monday
morning. Milder Monday afternoon and evening. Chilly again Monday
night into Tuesday morning especially across the southern interior
forecast area. A cold frontal passage is then forecast towards 
midweek.

&&

.DISCUSSION...as of 11:43 AM PDT Sunday...It's clear across the
forecast area, 24 hour trends show cooler temperatures compared to 
this time yesterday. At a slowed pace, daytime temperatures will 
continue warming up under a sunny sky this afternoon after a chilly
start this morning.

A Frost Advisory is in effect from 11 pm tonight to 9 am PDT 
Monday morning for the North Bay Interior Valleys, Coastal North 
Bay, San Francisco Peninsula Coast, East Bay Interior Valleys, 
Santa Cruz Mountains, Eastern Santa Clara Hills, Monterey Bay Area
including the Salinas Valley, Santa Lucia Mountains, Los Padres 
National Forest and Mountains of San Benito and Interior Monterey 
County including Pinnacles National Park. With residual 850 mb 
cold air advection from the Sacramento Valley today, much lowering
of surface dew points (drier) and less winds overnight, radiative
cooling to space, little if any cirrus clouds, night-time and morning
cold air drainage winds to our coastline, conditions are ideal for
a colder night and morning ahead. A few spots like Oakland downtown
and maybe San Francisco will be nearing October 24th record low 
temperatures Monday; added in a section below for records at the 
long term sites. 

Daytime highs recovering fairly nicely Monday afternoon with less
ideal conditions for chilly weather lingering Monday night to Tuesday
morning except possibly our southern interior (San Benito and Monterey
counties). As of current, the Frost Advisory only focuses on tonight
and Monday morning. An update was sent earlier this morning to lower
Monday morning's forecast low temperatures. 

Additional updates not anticipated at this time.

.AVIATION...As of 11:00 AM Sunday...For the 18Z TAFs. Satellite 
shows clear skies over the CWA and models are in agreement that 
VFR conditions will prevail throughout the TAF period. Post-
frontal N/NW winds will continue to gust this afternoon to ~20-25 
knots. High confidence that winds will start to calm to light 
winds tonight and will remain light/calm through tomorrow morning 
as we experience a transition from the trough passing through. 
Possible high clouds may be enter the CWA tomorrow morning but 
still remains VFR. 

Vicinity of KSFO...VFR through the TAF period with moments of FEW 
high clouds. Winds will remain gusty from the afternoon into the 
evening but high confidence winds will transition to light winds 
tonight and remain relatively light for the remainder of the TAF 
period. 

Monterey Bay...VFR through the TAF period, with moderate confidence 
of some high clouds around tomorrow morning. Gusty westerly winds 
near 20 kts, until the night where it becomes relatively light. 

&&

.MARINE...as of 10:47 AM PDT Sunday...North-northwest winds have 
begun to diminish this morning over the coastal waters but remain 
breezy. Despite diminishing winds near the coast, steep seas with 
wind waves of 9 to 12 feet at 5 to 6 seconds continue in addition
to the background northwest swell at 9 to 11 seconds and 
southerly swell at 18 seconds. North-northwest winds will continue
to be strong today with gale force gusts over the outer waters. 
Inexperienced mariners and small craft operators should continue 
to reamin in port or seek safe harbor as seas remain hazardous. 
Wave heights will subside on Monday into Tuesday but winds 
expected to be breezy still, especially near coastal jets and 
gaps.
