Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service San Francisco Bay Area
214 PM PDT Sun Oct 23 2022

.SYNOPSIS...A Frost Advisory is in effect from 11 pm tonight to 9
am PDT Monday morning for much of the Bay Area and north Central 
Coast mainly excluding urban areas such as San Francisco and along
the San Francisco Bay Shoreline. Colder temperatures developing 
tonight and early Monday morning as drier air continues to advance
over our forecast area coupled to light winds tonight and a clear
sky through sunrise Monday morning. Milder Monday afternoon and 
evening. Chilly again Monday night into Tuesday morning especially
across the southern interior forecast area. A cold frontal passage
is then forecast towards midweek.

&&

.DISCUSSION...as of 2:14 PM PDT Sunday...It's clear across the 
forecast area, 24 hour trends show temperatures are mainly cooler 
compared to this time yesterday. Cold air advection at the 850 mb 
level from the Sacramento Valley is peaking across our forecast 
area this afternoon. A combination of mainly light to moderate 
surface pressure gradients and residual lower level cold air 
advection is stirring up surface to lower level northerly winds 
again, though not to the extent as compared to Saturday.

A Frost Advisory is in effect from 11 pm tonight to 9 am PDT 
Monday morning for the North Bay Interior Valleys, Coastal North 
Bay, San Francisco Peninsula Coast, East Bay Interior Valleys, 
Santa Cruz Mountains, Eastern Santa Clara Hills, Monterey Bay Area
including the Salinas Valley, Santa Lucia Mountains, Los Padres 
National Forest and Mountains of San Benito and Interior Monterey 
County including Pinnacles National Park. As mentioned, residual 
850 mb cold air advection from the Sacramento Valley is peaking. 
With lowering surface dew points (continuing drying) and less 
winds overnight, radiative cooling to space, little if any cirrus 
clouds, night-time and morning cold air drainage winds to our 
coastline, conditions are ideal for a colder night and morning 
ahead. A few spots like Oakland downtown and maybe San Francisco 
will be nearing October 24th record low temperatures Monday; added
in a section below for records at the long term sites. 

Daytime highs recovering fairly nicely Monday afternoon with less
ideal conditions for chilly weather lingering Monday night to Tuesday
morning except possibly our southern interior (San Benito and Monterey
counties). As of current, the Frost Advisory only focuses on tonight
and Monday morning. An update was sent earlier this morning to lower
Monday morning's forecast low temperatures.

Tuesday a quickly moving, dry frontal system sweeps southward
across our forecast area. Northerly winds at the surface and aloft
will keep the frontal passage dry. A 500 mb shortwave ridge moves
across the Bay Area and north Central Coast Thursday into early
Friday before moving east of the Sierra Nevada. 500 mb troughing
then reestablishes over the West for the weekend and early next
week.

.AVIATION...As of 11:00 AM Sunday...For the 18Z TAFs. Satellite 
shows clear skies over the CWA and models are in agreement that 
VFR conditions will prevail throughout the TAF period. Post-
frontal N/NW winds will continue to gust this afternoon to ~20-25 
knots. High confidence that winds will start to calm to light 
winds tonight and will remain light/calm through tomorrow morning 
as we experience a transition from the trough passing through. 
Possible high clouds may be enter the CWA tomorrow morning but 
still remains VFR. 

Vicinity of KSFO...VFR through the TAF period with moments of FEW 
high clouds. Winds will remain gusty from the afternoon into the 
evening but high confidence winds will transition to light winds 
tonight and remain relatively light for the remainder of the TAF 
period. 

Monterey Bay...VFR through the TAF period, with moderate confidence 
of some high clouds around tomorrow morning. Gusty westerly winds 
near 20 kts, until the night where it becomes relatively light. 

&&

.MARINE...as of 10:47 AM PDT Sunday...North-northwest winds have 
begun to diminish this morning over the coastal waters but remain 
breezy. Despite diminishing winds near the coast, steep seas with 
wind waves of 9 to 12 feet at 5 to 6 seconds continue in addition
to the background northwest swell at 9 to 11 seconds and 
southerly swell at 18 seconds. North-northwest winds will continue
to be strong today with gale force gusts over the outer waters. 
Inexperienced mariners and small craft operators should continue 
to reamin in port or seek safe harbor as seas remain hazardous. 
Wave heights will subside on Monday into Tuesday but winds 
expected to be breezy still, especially near coastal jets and 
gaps.
