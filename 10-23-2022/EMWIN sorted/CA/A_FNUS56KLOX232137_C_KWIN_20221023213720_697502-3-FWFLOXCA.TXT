Fire Weather Planning Forecast For Southwestern California
National Weather Service Los Angeles/Oxnard CA
237 PM PDT Sun Oct 23 2022

...ELEVATED TO BRIEF CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS FOR MUCH OF LOS 
ANGELES AND EASTERN VENTURA COUNTIES TONIGHT INTO MONDAY DUE TO GUSTY 
SANTA ANA WINDS AND LOW HUMIDITIES...

.DISCUSSION...
Gusty northerly winds will continue across portions of southwestern 
California through this evening, with gusts generally between 25 and 45 
mph across the mountains, southern Santa Barbara county, Santa Clarita 
Valley, and San Fernando Valley. The above areas that see northerly 
winds will experience a drying trend, with humidities lowering to 
between 15 and 30 percent this afternoon, resulting in elevated fire 
weather conditions that should persist through early this evening.

The flow will shift to the northeast tonight and Monday across Los 
Angeles and Ventura counties, resulting in the first Santa Ana wind 
event of the season. Gusts between 25 and 45 mph are expected across the
typical wind prone areas of Los Angeles and eastern Ventura counties, 
with isolated gusts as high as 50 mph possible in the Los Angeles county
mountains. The offshore winds are also expected to reach wind prone 
coastal areas of Ventura county and Malibu late tonight into Monday 
morning. The winds are forecast to then diminish rather quickly mid to 
late Monday afternoon. Humidities will lower further on Monday with 
minimums between 8 and 20 percent. As a result, elevated to brief 
critical fire weather conditions can be expected across much of Los 
Angeles and Ventura counties tonight into Monday, with the worst 
conditions from mid Monday morning to early Monday afternoon. While 
there is about a 20 to 30 percent chance for a Red Flag Warning, the 
brevity of the critical wind and humidity combination are limiting 
factors to consider.

Winds will be weaker Monday night and Tuesday morning, however dry 
conditions will linger across the mountains and foothills. An onshore 
wind component will return Tuesday afternoon into Wednesday. There is a 
chance for generally weak offshore flow and lower humidities on Thursday
and Friday.
