Above normal temperatures will continue across West Central Texas 
through the next 24 hours, as weak upper level ridging dominates the 
region. Overnight lows will be generally be in the upper 50s to 
lower 60s, although a few locations along the Interstate 10 corridor 
may drop into the mid 50s. Highs on Saturday will be in the upper 
80s to lower 90s for most locations. Breezy south to southwest winds 
of 15 to 20 mph can be expected through much of the period. Lighter 
winds can be expected overnight across much of the Interstate 10 
corridor and across portions of the Heartland.

(Saturday night through next Thursday)

A broad upper level trough is indicated across the western US by
both the GFS and ECMWF. Eventually, as this low develops and
strengthens across the Texas Panhandle, there may be enough
support to develop rain showers and thunderstorms. In fact, a
minor disturbance may move across northern Mexico prior to this
system's arrival. If that scenario pans out, higher coverage may
result from the increase in moisture across the region. However,
that scenario remains a bit uncertain. However, we will likely see
cooler temperatures across the region as a cold front is dragged
across the region. Confidence in the cooler weather is high.
However, rain chances and rainfall totals remain uncertain at this
time. For now, keep an eye out for possible rain in the Sunday to
Monday night timeframe. That's really the main highlight of the
forecast.

gusts 25-29 knots at KABI/KSJT, with gusts at or slightly above 20
