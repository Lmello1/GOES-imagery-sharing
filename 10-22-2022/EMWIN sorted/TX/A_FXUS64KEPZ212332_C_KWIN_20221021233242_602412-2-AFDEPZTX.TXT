.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 128 PM MDT Fri Oct 21 2022

One more day of pleasant and warm weather can be expected across
the Borderland region, before a large storm system impacts the
region on Sunday. Wind to gusty conditions will accompany this
system as it moves across the region. By the start of next week, a
stout cold front will lead to much cooler temperatures and chances
of snow over the Sacramento and Gila Mountains. Quiet and cool
weather resumes for the middle part of next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(This evening through Saturday)
Issued at 128 PM MDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Quiet night expected tonight with the breezy wind becoming less than 
10 mph after dark and increasing cirriform clouds flowing through 
southern New Mexico. An upper level system will enter the Pac NW 
tomorrow, which will help break down the ridging that's been over 
the FA this week.  By peak heating Saturday, the system will have 
made it into roughly the southern OR/ID border. A low in the 
southern Pacific will help the subtropical jet to round the south 
side of that system, and be pushed over N. NM as the aforementioned 
Great Basin system digs southward. Soundings show the boundary layer 
mixing up to 700mb where winds of 25-35 knots will mix down to the 
surface as gusts from the W/SW on Saturday afternoon. Winds increase 
over the Black Range to Sacramento Mountains, where gusts to 40 mph 
will be possible. Dust models aren't showing tomorrow as a concern 
for dust issues at this time.  

Moisture will also increase ahead of the next system, with 0.7" of 
PW (north) to almost 1.0" PW near the International Border. There is 
little to no forcing overhead on Saturday, however CAMs show there 
may be a few orographically forced storms over the Gila Region 
Saturday afternoon.  

Despite minor height falls through the short term, LL WAA will help 
temperatures become a degree or so warmer on Saturday

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday night through next Thursday)
Issued at 128 PM MDT Fri Oct 21 2022

The long term period picks up on Saturday evening, with a deep
longwave trough over the PacNW. As it continues to dive
southeastward across the Intermountain West/Great Basin, it will
further suppress and push the upper level ridge south into 
Mexico. As this takes place, a fairly strong mid/upper level jet 
will develop across the Desert SW, as the mid-level pressure 
gradient tightens ahead of the approaching trough. The breezy 
west/southwest winds expected on Saturday (mentioned above in the 
short term discussion), will continue into the evening and 
overnight hours. Winds will range from 10-20 mph, higher gusts 
will be possible on the eastern slopes of area mountains during 
the late evening/overnight hours, especially as the atmosphere 
decouples as mixing heights quickly drop.

By Sunday, strong upper level trough now centered over UT/CO
border will bring with it a variety of impacts during the
afternoon and evening hours across the Borderland region. As the
base of the trough and the strongest corridor of mid/upper level
winds drops southeastward across the forecast area, windy to gusty
conditions can be expected. Forecast model soundings show winds
mixing up to ~700mb across the lowlands, that in combination with
momentum transfer to the surface, sustained winds of 20-30 mph
with gusts to 40 mph across the lowlands. The stronger winds 
across the area could lead to patchy areas of blowing dust, 
especially for areas west of the Rio. Mountain zones will see 
stronger winds as a 700mb jet develops over the Sacramento Mtns on
Sunday afternoon. However, there still remains a lot of 
uncertainty with regard to dust plume development. 700mb winds of 
55-65 kts will be likely just above the surface over the 
mountains, which will ultimately translate down to 30-40 mph 
winds, gusts to 55 mph over the Sacs. That being said, Wind 
Advisories will likely be needed for mountains zones (especially 
for the Sacs) on Sunday. For now, I'll pass that decision off to 
the overnight crew.

Modest amounts of moisture will also accompany the strong upper
level trough. With an increase of moisture expected ahead and
associated with the system, in combination with strong upper 
level dynamics, precip and PoPs chances increase on Sunday and 
Monday. On Sunday, the area will see mainly showers with a few 
areas of embedded thundershowers during the morning hours. By 
Monday, fairly stout cold front will move west to east across the 
area. Cooler temperatures will accompany the front as it traverses
the area, which could lead to snow showers over the Sacs and 
within the highest terrain of the Gila. As of now, any snow that 
falls will be relatively light with accumulations of an inch or 
two on Monday.

The remainder of the period will be quiet with temperatures 8-15
degrees below average. Worth mentioning, temperatures Tuesday
morning will be the coldest the area has seen so far this Fall.
Isolated lowlands locations could see their first freeze of the
Fall season as well.

.AVIATION...
(00Z TAFS)
Issued at 529 PM MDT Fri Oct 21 2022

VFR conditions with FEW250 becoming SCT-BKN100/250. Winds will
remain breezy for the next few hours before diminishing after
dark with direction 240-280 and speeds AOB 10 kts. Tomorrow 
afternoon, winds will increase from 230-260 with speeds 15-20 and 
gusts around 25 knots. Vis reductions from BLDU cannot be ruled 
out, especially for dust prone sites like DMN.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 128 PM MDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Increasing southwesterly flow will bring an increase in moisture and 
a slight chance of showers to the mountain zones Saturday afternoon. 
Winds will be breezy, with min RH topping out at ~30% in the 
lowlands. On Sunday, a storm system will bring a better chance for 
showers, but also stronger wind (20-30 mph). Min RH remains above 25 
percent. Sunday night, light shower chances spread area-wide, ending 
late Monday night. Rain totals are light overall - 0.25-0.5" in the 
mountains and T to 0.15" in the lowlands. On Monday, a strong cold 
front pushes through, bringing the first chance of light snow 
accumulations to the Gila Region and the Sacs. Vent rates good to 
excellent through Monday. On Tuesday, vent rates become poor to 
fair.
