Tonight and Tomorrow...

Current model guidance show a ridge axis lifting out of our CWA by 
tonight.  As the ridge axis lifts out of our area, winds will be 
steady most of the night due to a pressure gradient holding. This 
will result in overnight lows roughly 10 degrees warmer than 
previous nights with lows generally 50-60 degrees. This dry autumn 
weather pattern will continue on Saturday as a surface low forms 
over the Great Plains. In response to this, a pressure gradient 
will lead to wind gusts up to 25 mph across northwest portions of 
our forecast area. /CRJ/ 

Saturday night through Thursday night: A persistent dry and warmer 
weather pattern with surface high pressure wedged along the eastern 
flank of the Appalachians is expected to continue through Monday 
night. Increasing surface pressure gradient over the forecast area 
will bring a corresponding increase in southerly winds, particularly 
over the ArkLaMiss Delta region where peak daytime wind gusts could 
approach 30 mph. Although boundary layer moisture should improve 
enough to bring RH values above critical fire danger thresholds, the 
surface wind could be strong enough to raise concern, and will 
continue to monitor this for potential issuance of HWO graphics. 

Thereafter, a significant shortwave trough over the Plains states 
should approach the forecast area by Tuesday morning with warm 
advection shower chances developing late Monday night. Most guidance 
is becoming consistent and showing good agreement, so confidence is 
increasing that a line of showers/storms will move across the area 
Tuesday. Because of the preceding ridge and dry air, available 
moisture and instability are likely to be limited. Thus associated 
rainfall could be light on average, especially east of the MS River. 
A mild Pacific airmass will follow the front, and a return to dry 
weather is expected for the remainder of the forecast 
period. /EC/

.AVIATION...
(00Z TAFS)
Issued at 659 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Southerly winds will persist overnight, with some brief gusts
around 15mph psbl, especially at GLH. Some light-moderate LLWS, 
around 30kts within 2kft, is psbl between 22/05-12Z before winds 
increase at the sfc. At SE TAF aerodrome sites (i.e. PIB & HBG) 
some potential for some MVFR to brief IFR vis/fog is psbl between
22/10-13Z before VFR flight cats are expected areawide. Southerly
winds around 15-20mph, with brief gusts up to 30mph, are possible
Sat after 07/16Z, with best chances in NW & central TAF aerodrome
sites at GLH, GWO, HKS & JAN. These gusty winds will persist 
through the end of the period. /DC/
