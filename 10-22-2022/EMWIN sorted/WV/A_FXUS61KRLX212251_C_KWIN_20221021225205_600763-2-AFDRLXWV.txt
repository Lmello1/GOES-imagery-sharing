.NEAR TERM /THROUGH SATURDAY/...
As of 530 PM Friday...

Everything is on track so no changes were made to the forecast.

As of 1255 PM Friday...

A high pressure system will remain along or just east of the
mountains tonight and Saturday. This will provide dry weather
with a southwesterly flow for much of the region, but calm 
winds in the valleys in and near the mountains at night.

&&

.SHORT TERM /SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT/...
As of 300 PM Friday...

Seasonably chilly temperatures are expected Saturday night amid
patchy river valley fog (VA/WV). Mostly sunny skies during the 
day on Sunday will then provide for well above normal 
temperatures (low to mid 70s for the lowlands). This trend 
continues on Monday amid mostly sunny skies and similar 
temperatures. Patchy river valley fog is expected once again on 
Monday/Tuesday mornings in VA/WV.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
As of 300 PM Friday...

High pressure will continue to remain in control across the area
on Tuesday in advance of an approaching disturbance from the
west. This leads to another mild and dry day across the region,
with progged high temperatures ~ 10 degrees above normal, 
equating to mid 70s for the lowlands. An area of low pressure 
will then move northwest of the region on Wednesday, with an 
associated cold front passing through the area, resulting in 
shower chances Wednesday into Thursday morning, with PoPs 
capped at SLT to CHC for now. High temperatures on Wednesday 
will remain above normal, with slightly cooler temperatures for 
Thursday.
