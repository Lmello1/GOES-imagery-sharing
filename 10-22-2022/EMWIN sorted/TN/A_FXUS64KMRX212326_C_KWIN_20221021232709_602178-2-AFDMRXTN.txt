(This evening through Saturday)
Issued at 233 PM EDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Key Messages:

1. Dry weather with warming temperatures and slightly improving 
low humidity levels.

At the surface, high pressure is continuing to build over the 
Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic region, providing calm and dry 
conditions. Winds are a lot lighter today than yesterday 
afternoon. Dew points are running low again this afternoon, but 
expected to slightly improve tomorrow. Expect mostly sunny skies 
with high scattered to broken clouds at times.

A ridge aloft with it's axis extending SW to NE will build in 
higher heights, thus warming temperatures each day. Valley 
locations will break into the low 70s for Saturday afternoon. Very
localized dense fog around bodies of water is possible in the 
early morning hours under high pressure and little to no wind.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday night through next Friday)
Issued at 233 PM EDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Key Messages:

1. Warm and dry through Tuesday.

2. Rainfall possible on Tuesday night into Wednesday, albeit light 
amounts.

Discussion:

A persistent warm and dry pattern will continue into the longer 
range forecast. 

A weak shortwave will be translating across Kentucky at the start of 
the period. The deeper trough over the western U.S. on Sunday really 
becomes amplified. This will cause the ridge to build across the 
eastern U.S. providing ample warmth and a strong southerly flow. The 
trough slows down as the jet max on the west side continues to dig 
south while another upper low over the southeast Pacific gradually 
merges by late Sunday. Meanwhile, the ridge gets stronger over the 
east. 

It's not until the jet max rounds the base of the trough that it 
finally begins to move eastward on Monday. For our forecast area, 
the daytime temperatures will generally be in the mid to upper 70s 
with low temperatures in the 40s and 50s. Rainfall chances slowly 
increase on Tuesday night in the 20-30 percent range area-wide. To 
add insult to injury, the amount of rainfall expected will be dismal 
considering how far below normal we are. Most locations would be 
lucky to see more than one tenth of an inch - and that's pushing it. 
One other item of note is the surface low pattern setting up on 
Tuesday night into Wednesday. It favors stronger mountain wave 
winds, however, at this time the 850mb winds aren't quite as strong. 
This may change as the time frame in question gets closer. Just 
something to watch particularly as dry as we've been and any extra 
winds could cause fire spread.

After this system move east, we will return to daytime high 
temperatures in the 70s and low temperatures in the 40s and 50s. 
There is another system farther west we will keep an eye on as it 
might be potent enough to provide some much needed rainfall to the 
area next weekend. Time will tell.
