...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM MDT SATURDAY FOR GUSTY 
WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR FIRE WEATHER ZONES 315, 317, 
322, AND 326...

...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SATURDAY MORNING THROUGH 
SATURDAY EVENING FOR GUSTY WINDS AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR 
FIRE WEATHER ZONES 320, 321, 324, 325, 332, 333, 334, AND 335...

.DISCUSSION...Saturday will be a warm and dry day across 
southern portions of the forecast area, as a warm front sets up
across portions of northeast WY and southern SD. Southwesterly
winds will be very gusty to the south of the boundary. Red flag 
or near red flag conditions will likely develop across southern 
portions of the northeast WY plains into south central SD. Although 
RH's may struggle to reach criteria on portions of the northeast WY
plains, winds gusting to over 45 mph with dry fuels and near critical 
RH supports extension of the Red Flag warning there through Saturday.
Have issued a fire weather watch for the remainder of southern 
SD, pushing it north into the ESE portions of the Black Hills and 
surrounding plains given concerns on dry downslope flow.
