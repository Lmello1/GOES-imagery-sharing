DISCUSSION...
Southerly wind gusts have diminished this evening but are expected
to increase again after midnight as the low level jet increases
atop the region. Expect gusts up to 30 mph early Saturday morning 
across most of eastern Oklahoma and northwest Arkansas. The gusty
winds could impact any ongoing firefighting efforts, despite the 
higher overnight relative humidities.

Strong and gusty southerly winds are expected to continue 
through Sunday. Moisture return will be limited Saturday west of
Highway 75, elevating fire weather concerns. Winds peak on Sunday
with gusts to near 40 mph expected, but moisture return will lead
to higher humidities than on previous days. 

A frontal boundary will bring chances for storms beginning Sunday
night across mainly northeast Oklahoma into far northwest 
Arkansas, spreading into southeast Oklahoma and western Arkansas 
during the day Monday. Locally heavy rainfall will be possible.
