Issued at 309 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Fire weather will be a concern tomorrow afternoon across the western 
half of the CWA. For more information, refer to the fire weather 
section below.

Zonal flow will increase tonight aloft as the mid-latitude jet 
prepares to dig in to the west coast of the U.S. Interaction between 
this flow and the standing wave in the lee of the Rockies will allow 
for continued pressure falls on the High Plains, with the pressure 
gradient tightening over our CWA. Thus, while the boundary layer 
will decouple pretty rapidly after sunset, winds should remain 
southerly at about 10 mph tonight and some moisture return should be 
expected toward daybreak across the eastern half of the area. The 
combination of breezy conditions and some moisture return will keep 
lows in the upper 50s to low 60s near and east of I-44. In northwest 
Oklahoma, weaker winds nearer to the surface low and meager moisture 
return will allow lows to drip into the upper 40s.

Forecast trends suggest that westerly downsloping winds will 
penetrate further into the area than previous guidance showed 
tomorrow. It's possible that by late afternoon, the dryline has 
mixed as far east as I-35. Highs behind the dryline will flirt with 
record warmth, with upper 80s to low 90s expected. Further east, 
highs will still reach into the mid 80s with breezy conditions.

Issued at 309 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Fire weather will continue to be a concern on Sunday. For more 
information, refer to the fire section below.

Record warm lows are possible along and east of I-44 tomorrow night 
into Sunday morning. A combination of stronger moisture return with 
a 40-50 knot LLJ will prevent radiational cooling at the surface, 
and lows in the mid and potentially upper 60s are possible. Further 
to the west, lows will also be warm, in the low to mid 60s. The 
upper-level trough will eject into the Plains on Sunday, kicking off 
a complex weather pattern that will eventually lead to a cooldown 
and likely some rain chances.

A cold front will sweep through the CWA during the day on Monday, 
ending the snap of record warmth from this weekend. Models have 
begun converging toward a solution that shows the trough phasing 
with Tropical Storm Rosalyn as it passes northward through Mexico, 
with a tight closed low aloft passing over the Red River region from 
Monday into Tuesday. This is a favorable synoptic setup for a 
widespread rainfall event, and most models now suggest a swath of 1-
2 inches of rain from Monday into Tuesday. The greatest chance for 
soaking rainfall appears to be south and east of I-44 for now, but 
this could be an opportunity for much of the area to see heavy rain. 
Highs on Tuesday and Wednesday will drop to somewhat below-average 
areawide, and indications are that we won't see an immediate warm-up 
back to above-average conditions by the end of the week.

Gusty south to southwest winds will continue through the forecast
period, with diurnal weakening tonight and increase after 14Z
tomorrow. LLWS will be retained for most terminals overnight with
anticipated low level jet. VFR conditions expected to prevail.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 309 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Fire weather concerns will continue on Saturday and Sunday, 
especially across the western part of the CWA. Tomorrow will likely 
see a greater spatial extent of fire weather, while Sunday will be a 
less-certain forecast with higher-end potential for fire weather.

General expectation is that we see elevated to near-critical fire 
conditions tomorrow across western and northern Oklahoma and western 
north Texas. The dryline will mix eastward toward I-35, and with 
highs potentially topping 90 degrees relative humidity values will 
drop as low as 10 percent. Winds are forecast to be a touch weaker 
than they were today in the area with the lowest moisture content; 
thus, deferred on issuing a red flag warning and instead issued a 
fire weather watch for tomorrow.

Uncertainty about dryline location continues on Sunday. If anything, 
models now show the dryline further to the west, and it's possible 
that all of the CWA has humidity too high for fire weather to reach 
near-critical status. However, the airmass will continue to be very 
dry and windy behind the dryline, and near-critical to critical 
conditions are still distinctly possible if the dryline is in our 
area.
