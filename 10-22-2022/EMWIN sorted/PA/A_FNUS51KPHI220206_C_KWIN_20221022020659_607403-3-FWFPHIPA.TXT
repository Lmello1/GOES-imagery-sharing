.DISCUSSION...
High pressure over the region will result in dry conditions,
clear skies and moderating temperatures through Saturday.
Saturday night through Monday, a low pressure will move
northward off the coast, spreading clouds and potentially some
rain across the region. A lingering frontal boundary in its wake
may keep some clouds and showers around into the middle of next
week.
