...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
An isolated thunderstorm remains possible near coastal eastern
Florida.

...FL Atlantic Coast...

Pronounced upper trough is advancing across the FL Peninsula early
this evening. Large-scale forcing is now shifting east of FL and
will likely continue to aid scattered convection over the warmer
Gulf Stream. While a stray flash may be noted near the coast for the
next few hours, primary risk for deep convection will continue
shifting offshore.
