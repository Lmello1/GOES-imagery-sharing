DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Roslyn was
located near latitude 16.6 North, longitude 105.3 West.  Roslyn is
moving toward the west-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and a turn 
toward the northwest and north-northwest is expected overnight, 
followed by turn to the north on Saturday and a north-northeastward 
motion Saturday night and Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center 
of Roslyn will move parallel to the southwestern coast of Mexico 
tonight and early Saturday, then approach the coast of west-central 
Mexico, making landfall along this coastline Saturday night or 
Sunday morning.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Steady to rapid strengthening is expected during the next
day or so, and Roslyn is forecast to become a hurricane later 
tonight.  Roslyn is expected to still be a hurricane when it reaches 
the coast of west-central Mexico.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast within
the hurricane warning area by late Saturday or Saturday night.
Winds are expected to first reach tropical storm strength by midday
Saturday, making outside preparations difficult or dangerous.
Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to
completion.
 
Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area
beginning Saturday night or early Sunday, with tropical storm
conditions possible by Saturday evening.
 
Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical storm
warning area on Saturday or Saturday night.
 
RAINFALL: Roslyn is expected to produce the following rainfall
totals across coastal areas of southwestern and west-central
Mexico:
 
Guerrero and MichoacaÃÅn and the lower coast of Colima: 1 to 3 inches
 
Upper coast of Colima, Jalisco, western Nayarit including Islas
Marias, and southeastern Sinaloa: 4 to 6 inches with maximum amounts
of 8 inches
 
This rainfall could lead to flash flooding and landslides in areas
of rugged terrain.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the east of where the
center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Roslyn are affecting portions of the
coast of southwestern Mexico and will spread northward to the coast
of west-central Mexico and the southern portion of the Baja
California peninsula through the weekend.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
