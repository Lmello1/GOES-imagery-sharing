.SHORT TERM...(This evening through Saturday)
Issued at 1205 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

17Z observations are showing zonal flow in the mid and upper
levels with a weak 700 mb shortwave that is producing some mid and
upper level clouds. At the surface a wind shift line in
association with a trough is extending from central Kansas to 
northwest Texas and the winds in the vicinity of the boundary have
been staying fairly light.

Tonight should be a relatively mild night as a warm layer of air
moves through western Kansas. 850 mb temperatures are forecast to
be in the 22-24 (C) range and skew t soundings are showing a
strong inversion towards morning. Winds overall will continue
light and skies should be clear as lows fall into the mid to upper
40s.

Saturday looks fairly similar weather wise with the exception of 
the trough moving further east and the winds will be stronger out 
of the southwest. This combined with 850 mb temps staying around 
22 (C) and sunshine will lead to another warm day. Of note 12Z GFS
guidance give low 90s for highs in Dodge City and Liberal and 
near 90 at Med Lodge. I kept the inherited forecast of mid to 
upper 80s across the CWA although it wouldn't surprise me if we 
see some low 90s especially in the Red Hills region. Fire concerns
will be increased a bit on Saturday with the stronger winds and 
RH values falling to 12%...but the winds should stay below red 
flag criteria during the day. Upper level winds will continue 
zonal and the large Pacific system which will affect us on Sunday 
will have reached on shore and there could be a few mid to high 
level clouds with a wave that will move out of Colorado by the 
afternoon.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)
Issued at 215 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Key message continues to be the wind, critical fire, and blowing
dust potential on Sunday.

Latest model trends continue to show a large trough digging into
the Rockies during the day with a deepening surface low from
northeast Colorado through central Nebraska. Winds during the day
will increase as the surface low deepens and skew-t models are
showing 50 kt winds up to 600 mb in a good mixing environment. EPS
90th percentile winds in the 50-55 mph range. The latest 
deterministic and ensemble runs have been showing a little slower 
movement to the jet streak with the strongest winds entering 
southwest Kansas between 18-00Z. Also a layer of more moist air 
looks to be coming up out of Texas and Oklahoma in the morning 
which could help to mitigate the fire danger a bit at least 
initially. Towards afternoon and mid layer push of dry air will 
come from Hays to Elkhart and this should drop relative humidity 
values to 15%. Blowing dust will continue to be most likely the
highest of the impacts due to the drought and recently tilled
soils leading to lowered visibilities for travelers in the
afternoon. Overall the threats are the same but the timing of the
strongest winds and how the dry air evolves have changed a bit. 

Monday and Tuesday continue to introduce chances of rain however
it looks like Oklahoma, Texas, and south central and southeast
Kansas have the best chances. Canadian and GFS models continue to
show a closed low mid latitude cyclone moving through the Red
River valley leading to rain and storm chances in the southern
plains. The 06Z and 12Z deterministic Euro however have trended 
towards a faster moving progressive trough as well as the 12Z EPS
& GEFS ensembles showing the same which would reduce our chances 
of rain greatly in southwest Kansas and lessen them a bit in south
central Kansas. With the faster movement our QPF values will also
go down as it appears Pratt and Barber county have a chance at any
precipitation over 0.10 of an inch. As a result the POPs for 
Monday and Tuesday I loaded a 50/50 Euro/NBM to reflect these 
lower chances of rain. What will certainly happen is much cooler 
temperatures as we go from the 80s on Sunday to the 50s/60s on 
Monday. 

The next system of interest looks to come in Friday as
deterministic GFS and Euro have a trough moving from the Pacific
northwest through the central plains. It's very early to tell if
this will give us better chances of rain towards late next week
but it will be something to watch.

.AVIATION...(For the 00Z TAFS through 00Z Saturday evening)
Issued at 625 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Light wind and VFR conditions will prevail overnight and through 
early morning daylight hours Saturday. Winds will begin gusting 
mid morning Saturday up to 20 mph though the afternoon, while the 
dry atmosphere continues to to provide ceiling free conditions.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 230 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

A slightly higher fire risk for Saturday as relative humidity
values fall to around 10% and winds will be out of the southwest
at 10-20 mph. A red flag warning is not anticipated as the wind
conditions will be lower than criteria.

Sunday is still on track to the a critical fire weather day and it
will be mainly wind driven. Winds will increase during the late
morning and be sustained in the afternoon at 25-35 mph with gusts
up to 55 mph. There could be a brief moist air mass moving in from
the south during the morning which could mitigate the fire danger
briefly but by afternoon drier air will move through much of
western Kansas dropping relative humidity values to around 15-20%.
