.SHORT TERM...
(This evening through Sunday)
Issued at 157 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

High pressure over the area this morning into early afternoon has 
begun to slide towards the east as a weak trough moves into the 
area. This will give way to windy conditions in the short term with 
Sunday being the windiest day with gusts up to 30 mph as the trough 
deepens just our west. Rain chances stay low through the period with 
chances increasing in the long term.

Forecast high temperatures will be above average with highs in the 
upper 70s to mid 80s. Low temperatures are expected to be in the 50s 
and 60s.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday Night through next Friday)
Issued at 157 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Models continue to come into better agreement this afternoon and the 
overall forecast remains pretty much on track. Gusty south to 
southwest winds will increase fire concerns early in the period and 
then followed by widespread rain with a frontal passage early next 
week. The differences in the models continue to wane with each 
passing run and whatever differences that do exist will be blended 
together for the final solution. 

The period begins with a deepening upper level trough over the 
Intermountain West/Western High Plains and upper level ridging in the 
Gulf of Mexico. Tight pressure gradient will be well established by 
this point with a rather robust south to southwest flow pulling in 
moist and unseasonably warm air. 

Surface cyclogenesis will already be well underway with the low 
center somewhere over the Eastern Dakotas/Western Minnesota and 
pulling off to the Northeast. Ejecting system now expected to drag a 
cold front across the region on Tuesday as models continue to slow 
down its progress allowing more moisture to pool ahead of the 
advancing boundary and producing a better QPF signal.

Aforementioned pressure gradient will produce sustained winds to 15 
to 30 mph with gusts as high as 40 to 45 mph not out of the realm of 
possibility. Areas most susceptible to the strongest wind will be the 
higher elevations of the Ozark/Ouachitas and the Delta region. Wind 
advisories will likely be needed at some point moving forward but 
will not be included in this forecast package. Fire weather remains 
a concern as fuels are essentially cured but the increase in 
moisture/humidity will mitigate, but not eliminate, the fire threat. 
Numerous burn bans remain in effect.

Convection is expected to increase Monday morning over the west and 
gradually spread east with time. The best rain chances look to be 
Monday night and Tuesday as the front approaches and moves through. 
Another low is expected to develop on the boundary somewhere near 
the Red River as the system moves through  This may result in enough 
dry slotting to bring lower QPF to the parts of the state. The 
highest amounts still favor northwest and west central Arkansas. The 
severe weather threat remains minimal even with an impressive amount 
of shear but any real instability looks to be lacking although 
isolated to strong low end severe storms can not be completely ruled 
out. 

Once the front passes, surface ridging will cross the Central Plains 
with northerly surface flow prevailing locally. Flow aloft will 
briefly transition to quasi-zonal before another upper trough digs 
into the Desert Southwest late in the week. Southwesterly flow will 
return in the mid/upper levels, and as the aforementioned surface 
ridge moves east, southerly flow will become re-established in the 
low levels. Another warming/moistening trend will accompany this 
shift with rain chances increasing to our west by Thursday night.

Temperatures will average above normal before FROPA and return to 
near average or slightly below after.

(00Z TAFS)
Issued at 637 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

VFR conds across all TAF sites for the entire forecast period. 
Across the northern sites of KHRO and KBPK, wind shear will be 
present from 22/03Z until 22/16Z. Sfc winds will gust at 22/14Z and 
remain through the period w/ gusts as high as 29 knots. Across the 
central sites of KLIT/KHOT/KADF, wind shear will be present from 
22/03Z until 22/16Z. Sfc winds will gust at 22/15Z and remain 
through the period w/ gusts as high as 24 knots. Across the SE sites 
of KPBF and KLLQ, wind shear will be present from 22/03Z until 
22/14Z. Sfc winds will gust at 22/15Z and remain through the period 
w/ gust as high as 24 knots.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 157 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Strong south to southwest winds are expected through Monday with 
winds gusting in excess of 40 mph possible especially over the 
higher elevations and in the Delta. These winds, combined with 
critically dry fuels, will lead to an increase in fire danger. 
Humidity will remain elevated to mitigate fire weather concerns to a 
point but the finer fuels such as grasses and brush are more than 
dry enough to carry surface fire with the expected winds. Most 
Arkansas counties are under a burn ban and any burning is highly 
discouraged this weekend and into early next week.
