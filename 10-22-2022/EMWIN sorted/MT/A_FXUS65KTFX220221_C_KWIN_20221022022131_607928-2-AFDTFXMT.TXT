Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Great Falls MT
821 PM MDT Fri Oct 21 2022

.SYNOPSIS...
A dynamic weather system is still on track to impact the region 
beginning tonight through much of Sunday. Mountain snow and lower 
elevation rain on Saturday will transition to snow at most 
elevations Saturday night into Sunday. Looking toward next week, the 
pattern looks to remain unsettled. 

&&

.UPDATE...
Updated forecast is out. Main adjustment was to increase Pops this
evening for areas east of Great Falls where it raining/snowing.
Snow levels were around 7000 feet this evening and lowering. The
snow level will generally continue to lower all the way down to
the lowest elevations over the next 24 hours. Current winter
highlights in effect look on track, with a warning for most
mountain locations and an advisory for the valleys. The exception
is the Havre area where there is no lower elevation advisory.

The heaviest snowfall still looks to fall from Saturday afternoon
into Sunday morning. Overnight lows on Saturday will go below
freezing, thus impacts from snowfall will start to increase
starting Saturday night. Brusda

.AVIATION...
625 PM MDT Fri Oct 21 2022 (22/00Z TAF period)

Expect lowering ceilings into LIFR/IFR conditions overnight and into 
Saturday morning. By Saturday afternoon LIFR conditions will be 
possible in some areas as ceilings lower quite a bit. The rain will 
change to snow in the mountain overnight, with the rain changing to 
snow at lower elevations mostly on Saturday afternoon. Widespread 
impacts because of snow are expected Saturday night into Sunday. 
Mountains/passes will be obscured across the region through the 
period. Brusda

KWYS TAF will not be issued again until airport operations 
resume next spring.

weather and hazard information.

.PREV DISCUSSION...
/ISSUED 625 PM MDT Fri Oct 21 2022/
The remainder of today through Sunday... An upper level disturbance 
just off the west coast of the US is digging southeastward. 
Associated moisture is streaming into the region from the west as 
noted on water vapor imagery this afternoon. Although moisture is 
streaming in from aloft, only light precipitation is being observed 
at the surface across much of the region. The downsloping nature of 
winds has largely limited meaningful precipitation to areas 
immediately along the Rocky Mountain Front in the vicinity of the 
East side of Glacier NP. 

The continued push of moisture will translate closer to the surface 
across the region as the remainder of the afternoon and evening goes 
on. Hence, chances for mountain snow and lower elevation rain will 
increase through the evening today.

Snow levels slowly drop through the day Saturday and by Saturday 
night, most low level locations should transition to entirely snow. 
See local Winter Storm Warnings and Winter Weather Advisories for 
specifics regarding snow accumulation and timing. -AM 

Sunday night through next Friday...This section is brought to you by 
the letter "U" for uncertainty. What is certain is the cooler and 
somewhat active pattern, which is expected to persist through much 
of next week.

The trough responsible for the snowfall deepens well into Southwest 
CONUS, moving eastward and exiting the region Monday, returning a 
zonal flow aloft. Gusty winds continue into Tuesday along the Rocky 
Mountain Front and adjacent plains, with a high (70-80%) chance of 
winds exceeding 50 mph. Due to the nature of this being several days 
out, uncertainty remains regarding any highlights at this time.

A second, equally as deep, positively-tilted trough makes way across 
the Rockies from the Gulf of Alaska late Thursday, yet exits 
eastward as quickly as it arrives by late Friday. As previously 
mentioned, these passing troughs result in a cooler, somewhat active 
pattern. Afternoon temperatures fall just below seasonal averages 
and there are additional opportunities for snow, albeit a low (<30%) 
chance. Wednesday afternoon looks the most promising at this time, 
with a medium (50-60%) chance of precipitation across Southwest 
Montana and along the Rocky Mountain Front, with a low (<30%) chance 
elsewhere. Long-range models suggest this pattern sticks through for 
the remainder of October, leading me to believe that Fall may have 
finally decided to join us after all. - Pierce
