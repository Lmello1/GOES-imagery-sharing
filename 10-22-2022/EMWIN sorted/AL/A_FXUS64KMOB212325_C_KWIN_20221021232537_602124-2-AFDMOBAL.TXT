NEAR TERM...
(Now through Saturday)
Issued at 316 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Dry weather persists through early this weekend.

Skies will remain clear across most of the area this afternoon and 
evening with only a few clouds observed (generally west of I-65) on 
satellite imagery at this hour. Temperatures are on track to top out 
in the mid to upper 70s during peak heating this afternoon.

A mid and upper level trough exiting the East Coast continues to 
drift east today and tonight with a weak remnant low lingering off 
the GA/FL coast by Saturday. This results in a weak mid and upper 
level ridge building into the region late tonight on the backside of 
the exiting trough and low. Meanwhile, the region remains on the 
southwest periphery of a surface high draped down the East Coast, 
which maintains a generally easterly to southeasterly flow through 
the period. The area remains very dry through the period (ensemble 
mean PWATs remain below 0.9 inches) despite winds slowly turning 
more southeasterly. However, both the daytime highs and overnight 
lows will warm up in this pattern. Expect lows to fall into the 40s 
for locations generally east of I-65 with low 50s further to the 
west overnight with warmer temperatures at the beaches. Highs 
tomorrow will generally top out in the upper 70s to low 80s by the 
middle to latter half of the afternoon.

Rip current risk remains low. 07/mb

SHORT TERM...
(Saturday night through Monday night)
Issued at 316 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Dry conditions continue as our drought will look to increase
throughout the period. Really no relief on the way through the end
of the weekend as a large ridge of high pressure builds over the 
western Gulf and a weak upper level low drifts north into the
Carolinas. This will keep us in a rather dry regime with primarily
a temperature forecast. Given the increasing subsidence on the
north side of the building ridge and slowly increasing
southwesterly flow. Temperatures this Sunday and Monday will climb
into the low to mid 80s as lows increase into the 50s. Dewpoints
will also slowly climb each night. BB/03

LONG TERM...
(Tuesday through Friday)
Issued at 316 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Our next low chance of rain comes Tuesday night into Wednesday
before, you guessed it, drying out once again. A large upper level
low will move out over the Four Corners region and into the Mid-
Mississippi valley by Wednesday. Upper level ridging will build
northward across the area on Tuesday leading to increasing
moisture within the deep southwesterly flow aloft. A weak cold
front associated with the upper level low will push through the
area late Tuesday afternoon and into early Wednesday morning.
Unfortunately most of the forcing will be focused over northern
Alabama and southern Tennessee leaving us in a rather benign
setup. Really do not expect much more than scattered storms along
the approaching cold front and then decreasing to more isolated as
the front approaches the coast. Some instability may be present
along the coast; however, mid-level temperatures appear to be too
warm to get any appreciable instability any stronger storms will
likely be limited by this. The upper trough will lift to the
northeast by Wednesday bringing rather benign westerly flow 
aloft. This will place us right back to where we were over the 
weekend with dry and seasonable weather heading into next weekend.
Highs will be in the upper 70s to low 80s most of the week 
increasing by the weekend. Lows will remain mild with lows mainly 
in the 50s even behind the cold front. BB/03

MARINE...
Issued at 316 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022
No significant impacts are expected for the marine area 
through the weekend. Weak easterly flow will continue today, then shift 
easterly to southeasterly tonight through Monday, while increasing
slightly along with slight build in seas. A light to moderate 
southeasterly flow is then expected by Tuesday ahead of an 
approaching cold front. BB/03
