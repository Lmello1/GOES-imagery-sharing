...FLASH FLOOD WATCH FOR THE CEDAR CREEK FIRE BURN SCAR REMAINS IN 
EFFECT THROUGH LATE TONIGHT...

  rainfall are possible over and downstream/downriver of the Cedar 
  Creek Fire burn scar.

* WHERE...A portion of northwest Oregon, including the following 
  areas, Cascade Foothills in Lane County and Cascades in Lane 
  County. This includes Oakridge and Westfir.

* WHEN...Through late tonight.

* IMPACTS...Heavy rainfall over the Cedar Creek Fire burn scar is 
  expected during the period of the watch. Heavy rainfall could 
  trigger flash flooding of low-lying areas and debris flows in and 
  near recent wildfire burn scars. Residents near the Cedar Creek 
  Fire burn scar should prepare for potential flooding impacts.
  Debris flows could move downstream along Salmon Creek flowing into 
  Oakridge, the North Fork of the Middle Fork of the Willamette 
  River flowing into Westfir, and Salt Creek and adjoining 
  infrastructure including Oregon highway 58. Debris might 
  eventually flow down river as far as Lookout Point Reservoir.

  - National Weather Service Meteorologists are forecasting heavy
    rainfall exceeding 1 inch in less than 6 hours over the burn
    scar, which may lead to flash flooding and debris flows.
