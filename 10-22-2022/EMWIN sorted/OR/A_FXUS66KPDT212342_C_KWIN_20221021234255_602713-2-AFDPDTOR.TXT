.AVIATION...00Z TAFs...A mix of VFR and MVFR conditions expected
due to rain and mist, with VIS 3-5 SM for periods, and CIGS around
or below 3K ft. Winds expected to be gusty overnight into
tomorrow, between 20-30kts, with strongest winds DLS/PDT/RDM/BDN.
Rain expected all sites through tomorrow morning, lessening into
the afternoon. Goatley/87

.PREV DISCUSSION... /issued 315 PM PDT Fri Oct 21 2022/ 

SHORT TERM...Primary concerns in the short term revolve around
the first significant Pacific storm of fall. Ample moisture
transport into the Pacific Northwest and synoptic support will 
lead to widespread wetting rains (>0.10") for most of the CWA 
through Saturday, while higher mountains above 4000 feet will see 
heavy, wet snow. After taking a critical look at forecast QPF and 
snow totals, office concensus was to issue Winter Weather 
Advisories for the East Slopes of the Oregon Cascades and the 
northern Blue Mountains of OR/WA for areas above 4500 feet as 
forecast amounts are on the low end of advisory criteria and this 
is the first event of the year. Other concerns include the 
potential for strong downslope winds of 40-55 mph in central 
Oregon, generally from Madras to La Pine, late this evening and 
tonight. HREF ensemble mean suggests the strongest gusts may not 
mix down so have opted to hold off on any Wind Advisories for 
now. Debris flow potential from burn scars such as the Cedar Creek
and Double Creek fires are also holding our attention, though at 
least the stratiform nature of the precipitation is less conducive
to such activity. Nevertheless, QPF of 2-3 inches for the Cedar 
Creek fire, with 30-50% neighborhood probabilities of >1"/3hr in 
HREF guidance suggests a decent chance of heavy precipitation. 
Further east, lower precipitation amounts of 0.75-1.5" are 
forecast for the Double Creek area, though due to the extremely 
steep nature of the terrain this is also an area of interest 
heading into the night. Heading into Sunday, will see a relative 
break in the precipitation, though with colder air filtering in 
behind the trough, focus will shift to freeze potential for Sunday
and Monday mornings. Plunkett/86

LONG TERM...Monday through Friday...An upper ridge between
weather systems will depart the area with another upper trough to
move into the region during the afternoon and evening Monday. Both
the deterministic and ensemble forecasts are in very good 
agreement with the timing and movement of this next system. It 
will bring more rain and mountain snow. However, snow levels will 
be rising as warmer air is advected into the forecast area. Snow 
levels will begin at 2500-4000 early Monday morning, rising to 
near 8000 ft in the southwest CWA and around 6000 feet in the 
northwest CWA. Only eastern Wallowa County will have snow levels 
below 5K ft in the afternoon. However, snow levels will rise there
as well overnight Monday night, changing all precipitation over 
to rain at most elevations. The upper trough axis with this 
system will drop southeast and will be over eastern OR/WA by late 
Wednesday morning. The day 4-6 cluster analysis are in very good 
agreement between each cluster and with the deterministic model 
solutions. Therefore have high confidence with the forecast of 
this weather system. Snow levels will remain elevated through 
Monday night and then they will drop on Tuesday as the upper 
trough drops southward and colder air moves back into the region. 
Therefore rain will change back over to snow in the higher 
mountain peaks and ridges on Tuesday. The highest POPs will be 
Monday afternoon and evening, with a brief decrease on Tuesday, 
and then increasing again by Tuesday night into Wednesday. There 
will be a potential need for winter weather highlights for the 
mountains with this system. 

A transitory upper ridge will then move across the region in the
progressive flow aloft on Thursday through Friday morning. 
Precipitation chances will decrease during this time, especially 
in southern and eastern areas of the CWA. There will be a 
continued chance of rain and higher elevation snow over the 
Cascade east slopes, with slight chances of rain over the lower 
elevations of the northwest forecast area. POPs will then 
increase to the chance category over all of the forecast area 
again by Friday evening. The day 7 cluster analysis are not in as 
good of agreement between the different clusters, with a couple 
showing an upper ridge over the CWA and others showing either a 
southwest flow or an upper trough. In addition, there are 
increasing discrepancies between the ECMWF and GFS deterministic 
models. As a result, confidence in the day 7 forecast (Friday) is 
lower than days 4-6 (Monday - Thursday).

Temperatures will remain cool through the extended period with
highs in the 50s to lower 60s in the lower elevations (which is 
close to the seasonal normal for late October). In the mountains,
highs will be mostly in the 40s to lower 50s. Lows are expected to
be mostly in the 20s mountains and 30s lower elevations...with 
possible teens in high elevation meadows if there is enough
clearing at night to allow for good radiational cooling.

Wind will become locally breezy, especially in the Lower Columbia
Basin and Blue Mountain Foothills, Monday - Wednesday afternoons,
and then light winds on Thursday and Friday, and during the late
night and early morning Monday - Wednesday. 88
