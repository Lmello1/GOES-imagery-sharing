.DISCUSSION...
Issued at 240 PM EDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Beautiful days with mostly clear skies across our region as we 
are under the influence of a strong high pressure ridge. It should
continue to stretch down into the Southeast through the weekend 
bringing more dry air over the area. As a result, a stable 
environment should prevail for the next few days with no rain 
chances on the forecast. Model sounding keep PWAT values lower 
than 1 inch. In terms of the winds, this pattern will continue to 
support surface winds to remain generally from the N/NE, becoming 
more light and from the E by early next week. 

Today, as we move into the afternoon, we can continue to enjoy 
pleasant weather with daytime max temperatures forecast to peak 
into the mid to upper 70s. However, one last cool night is expected
this evening with overnight lows ranging from the mid 40s north 
to the upper 50s south. Highs for tomorrow are forecast to be in 
the lower 80s, with overnight lows in the mid 50s north to the 
lower 60s south. Then, maximum temperatures should remain more 
consistent for the rest of the forecast period, reaching the mid 
80s with lows in the 60s.

For the end of next week, upper level disturbances can increase 
moisture into the area and some showers can't be ruled out of the 
forecast.

.MARINE...
Issued at 240 PM EDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Recent data from the surrounding buoys suggest winds from the N/NE 
at 10 to 15 knots and wave height between 1 to 2 feet near shore, 
and 2 to 3 in the outer waters. Dominant N/NE wind flow is expected 
to continue through the weekend, then becoming more from the east 
during the beginning of next week. Mostly clear skies and rain free 
over the coastal waters as an area of high pressure continues to 
stretch over the waters. Cooler/drier air remains in place for 
today, temperatures should start to warm a little bit during the 
weekend.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 240 PM EDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Today should be the driest day across fire districts, but humidity 
values should increase into the weekend. Today, minimum relative 
humidities are expected to range from the mid 20s to upper 30 
percent from the Nature Coast and extending south to Manatee County. 
Northerly winds should will be in place through the weekend, 
gradually becoming more easterly by early next week. Winds speeds 
should stay below critical levels, so no headlines would be needed 
during this time.
