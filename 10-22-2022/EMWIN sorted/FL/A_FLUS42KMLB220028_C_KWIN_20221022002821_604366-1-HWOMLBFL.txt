A Beach Hazards Statement is in effect for strong southward 
flowing current within the surf zone. Additionally there is a
mentionable threat of rip currents.

.WIND AND SEA IMPACT...
North winds 15 to 20 knots will produce choppy seas up to 6 feet
over the Gulf Stream, well offshore of Brevard county and the 
Treasure coast waters. Small craft should exercise caution.

.RIVER FLOOD IMPACT...
Flooding along the Middle Saint Johns River Basin continues as 
the river slowly recedes. Interests along the river are reminded 
that it will take several weeks for the river to return to its 
banks.

The St. Johns river at Astor is currently around 4.0 feet. 
Northerly winds are expected slow or halt the decline, keeping the
river at or near Major Flood Stage into the weekend.

Near Deland, the river will remain in Flood Stage at or above 4.0 
feet for the foreseeable future. The river is currently at 5.7 
feet, and is forecast to very slowly decline to 5.4 feet by the 
late weekend.

Near Sanford, the river will remain in Flood Stage at or above 5.5 
feet for the foreseeable future. The river is currently at 8.0 
feet, and is forecast to very slowly decline to 7.9 feet by the 
late weekend.

At Geneva above Lake Harney, the river will remain above the 10.0 
foot threshold for Major Flood Stage for the foreseeable future.
The river is at 10.7 feet and is forecast to very slowly decline 
to 10.6 feet by the late weekend.

Near Cocoa, the river remains just above Minor Flood Stage at 
16.1 feet. It is forecast to continue a slow decline, falling 
below Minor Flood Stage of 16.0 feet this weekend.

.DAYS TWO THROUGH SEVEN...SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY.
A Low to Moderate risk of dangerous rip currents is expected to 
continue during the weekend with surf remaining choppy. A few
lightning storms will remain possible over the Atlantic waters.

late this weekend, with seas building up to 7 to 8 feet.
