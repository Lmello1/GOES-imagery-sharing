Dry and mild conditions will continue through the weekend. A frontal 
boundary will become draped from west to east across the area on 
Saturday, with somewhat cooler air to the north of it and warmer air 
to the south. There is the potential for elevated fire danger 
Saturday afternoon south of the front, mainly along and south of a 
line from Milbank to Murdo, where minimum relative humidity values 
will fall to around 20 percent. The rest of the region will see 
minimum relative humidities in the 25 to 30 percent range.
