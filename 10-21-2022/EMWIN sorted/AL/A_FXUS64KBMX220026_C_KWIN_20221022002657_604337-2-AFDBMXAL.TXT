.SHORT TERM...
(Tonight through Saturday)
Issued at 719 PM CDT FRI OCT 21 2022

Surface dew points running around 10 degrees higher than yesterday
at sunset. Therefore, most locations are also reporting
temperatures that are higher. Surface high pressure ever so slowly
moves eastward through Saturday with surface winds more southerly
area wide. The moisture content has increased more in the west and
will lead to an east to west overnight low temperature gradient.
Did not make any big changes as lows near 40 east and near 50
west. Overall cloud cover will remain limited through Saturday 
with an overall dry airmass still overhead.

Previous short-term discussion:
(This evening through Saturday)
Issued at 1224 PM CDT FRI OCT 21 2022

The forecast area is positioned just east of a deepening trough 
over the Carolinas while shortwave ridging was building over the 
Arklatex Region into the Mid-South Area. Surface high pressure 
extended from the Central Gulf Coast northeast across the 
Appalachians into New England. A cold front was moving southeast 
across the Northern Plains today.

Today.

Expect very dry conditions to persist throughout the area today 
with only a few high cirrus clouds over the area. As the elongated
area of surface high pressure slowly moves further northeast, 
expect winds to become more southerly with speeds from 5-10 mph 
through the afternoon. The warming trend will continue today as 
highs will range from the upper 60s in the higher elevations east 
to the mid 70s west.

Tonight.

Shortwave ridging to our west will move east over the area 
tonight while troughing will consolidate over the Southeast 
Atlantic Coastline to our east. Elongated surface high pressure 
will become positioned roughly down the Appalachian Mountains 
while a cold front continues moving southeast into the Central 
Plains and Midwest Regions. Expect mostly clear skies overnight as
high cirrus continues to move over the area. Southerly winds will
decrease to 2-4 mph overnight. Lows will range from around 40 far
east to near 50 far west and northwest.

Saturday.

Shortwave ridging will dampen as it moves east o the area while a
zonal flow pattern will become established over the Southern 
Plains. The trough to our southeast will close off into an upper 
low off the Northeast Florida Coast while some shortwave impulses 
will move northeast over the Central Plains. Surface high pressure
will consolidate from New England southeast into the Mid Atlantic
region wile surface low pressure deepens well to our northwest 
over Wyoming into South Dakota. Skies will be mostly sunny across 
the eastern and southern counties while partly cloudy skies are 
expected west and northwest later in the day. Winds will become 
southwesterly with speeds from 5-10 mph. The airmass will continue
to moderate with highs in the 70s areawide, ranging from the low 
70s in the higher elevations east to the upper 70s west and 
southwest.

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday night through next Thursday)
Issued at 313 PM CDT FRI OCT 21 2022

Long term forecast remains on track this afternoon. Did make some
refinements to temperatures Sunday and Monday, to reflect a 
warmer trend. Also adjusted timing of rain chances for the mid 
week system. QPFs remain low - less than one half inch.

Previous long-term discussion:
(Saturday through Thursday)
Issued at 405 AM CDT FRI OCT 21 2022

Sunday through Thursday.

High pressure will remain in place over the Appalachians Sunday
and Monday between a strong storm system entering the Plains and 
a weakening system along the East Coast. Dry conditions will 
continue with cool mornings and warm afternoons. 

A strong shortwave trough is expected to move toward the Lower 
Mississippi Valley Tuesday, enhancing southerly flow and moisture 
advection across the Deep South. A band of showers and perhaps a 
few thunderstorms should accompany a cold front as it swings 
across the region Tuesday evening through Wednesday morning. The 
forward speed of this system should be sufficient for dry 
conditions to return for Thursday.

.AVIATION...
(00Z TAFS)
Issued at 719 PM CDT FRI OCT 21 2022

VFR conditions still prevail with limited cloud cover expected
through the period, although some cumulus and cirrus will be
present. Light to calm winds overnight. Surface high slowly 
drifts eastward Saturday leading to more southerly winds around 
6kts.

.FIRE WEATHER...

RH values on Saturday should increase for portions of Central
Alabama but remain in the 25 to 35 percent range for locations
near and east of I-65. Drier air will spread back to the west on 
Sunday with widespread RH values in the 28 to 35 percent range
areawide. 20 foot winds should average less than 10 knots through
the weekend, generally from a southerly to southeasterly heading.
