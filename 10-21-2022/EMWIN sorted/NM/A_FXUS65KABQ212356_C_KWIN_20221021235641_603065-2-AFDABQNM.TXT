.SYNOPSIS...
Issued at 142 PM MDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Winds will increase through the weekend in advance of a storm
system moving toward New Mexico from over the Pacific Northwest
and Great Basin. Windy conditions are expected Saturday and very 
windy conditions are forecast Sunday, especially across the
northeast quarter of the state where strong to damaging winds are
possible. Chances for showers will trend up over the mountains
Sunday, then expand Sunday night into Monday to include much of
the area as the storm system moves southeast over the area. 
Accumulating snow is likely in the mountains, with snow possibly 
reaching valley floors across western and central New Mexico early
Monday. This could be an early first snowfall of the season for a
number of lower elevation locales. In the wake of the departing 
system Monday night, the first freeze of the season is forecast 
for a number of central New Mexico locales. Despite some warming 
Tuesday into Wednesday, daytime temperatures will remain below 
normal. Another quick-hitting system may impact the area toward 
the end of next week.

.SHORT TERM...
(This evening through Saturday night)
Issued at 142 PM MDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Spectacular weather conditions the past few days will transition 
toward a more active pattern thru early next week. Westerly winds 
are increasing over the region today with gusts of 25 to 35 mph in 
most areas. Zonal flow will continue strengthening tonight as the H5 
ridge breaks down over northern MX in response to a deepening upper 
wave entering the Great Basin. Surface winds will increase to Wind 
Advisory by Saturday morning along the east slopes of the Sangre de 
Cristos where thermal profiles are conducive to crashing mt waves. 
Speeds aloft continue strengthening up to 105 kt thru Saturday and 
Saturday night with a surface low deepening to near 988mb along the 
Front Range by Sunday morning. Advisory gusts will continue Saturday 
and Saturday night in the Sangre de Cristos and spread to other high 
terrain areas like the Chuska Mts and perhaps the Tusas and Gila 
region overnight. Temps will remain above normal in this pattern as 
we await much colder air on the horizon. Now is the time to finish 
any final preparations to winterize your home and vehicles.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Thursday)
Issued at 142 PM MDT Fri Oct 21 2022

The subtropical and polar jet streams will phase over the area on
Sunday, topping 140kts at 250mb as the upper level trough/low
approaches from over the Great Basin. The result will be a very
windy day across the entire area, with the potential for strong 
to damaging winds across the northeast quarter of the state thanks
in part to a rapidly deepening lee side trough with a lee side 
low down to 985mb across northeast CO. Wind highlights are likely
for Sunday, but confidence on reaching high wind warning threshold
is low to moderate at this time. Orographically forced showers
will be on the uptrend Sunday, but snow levels will remain
relatively high. That will change Sunday night into Monday as the
upper level trough/low moves southeast across the state, boosting
chances for showers and lowering snow levels. The 12Z model
solutions are adding a bit of uncertainty to the rain/snow
forecast for late Sunday night through Monday, with the NAM
offering a closed upper low that moves slower and wraps moisture 
north into central NM Monday. Meanwhile, the ECMWF and GFS are 
more progressive and the ECMWF never closes off a low. At this 
time, it looks like Winter Weather Advisories may be necessary for
the northern and possibly the western mountains, with either a 
mix of rain/snow between 6000-7500ft or a change over to non- 
impactful snow (melting on contact). This could be an early first 
snowfall of the season for a number of western and central NM 
lower elevation locales such as Albuquerque and Santa Fe. Not the 
earliest on record, but early compared to the average 1st snowfall
dates. The upper level trough/low will depart quickly Monday 
night and if surfaces are wet Monday night then areas of fog or 
freezing fog may develop in it's wake Tuesday morning. 
Additionally, the 1st freeze of the season is on tap for a number 
of lower elevation locales (including ABQ) Monday night and a 
Freeze Warning will likely be required. Warming is forecast 
Tue/Wed, but daytime temperatures will remain below normal. Both 
the 12Z GFS and ECMWF show another quick-hitting upper level 
trough/low for next Thursday.

.AVIATION...
(00Z TAFS)
Issued at 550 PM MDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Upper level ridge will continue breaking down during the TAF
period. Increasing wly and swly sfc winds will take hold tonight 
becoming more widespread aft 22/16Z with gusts between 20 and 30 
kts expected in the aftn. Overnight, LLWS will increase across 
the central mts and ewd, as well as the potential for mt waves 
along the east slopes of the central mts. VFR will prevail at all
terminals during the fcst period.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 142 PM MDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Marginal critical fire weather will occur for a couple hours over 
parts of northeast NM Saturday with low humidity, gusty west winds, 
and above normal temperatures. Winds will strengthen further in the 
high terrain Saturday night before becoming more widespread Sunday. 
Gusts up to 65 mph are possible in the mountains with gusts of 40 to 
50 mph common elsewhere Sunday. Much colder air will arrive Sunday 
night along with potential rain and high terrain snow Monday and 
Monday night. Forecast confidence remains low however light to 
perhaps moderate snowfall accumulations are possible. Widespread 
freezing temperatures will occur Monday night and Tuesday night 
followed by a slow warming trend through next week.
