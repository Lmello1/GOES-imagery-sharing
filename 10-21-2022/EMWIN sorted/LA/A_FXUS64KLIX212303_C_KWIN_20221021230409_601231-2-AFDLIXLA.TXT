Mid-upper level ridging coupled with surface high pressure will 
provide stellar fall conditions across the area this weekend with 
clear conditions, morning lows in the 50s and 60s and high 
temperatures in the low 80s. Low-level moisture is returning as 
winds have shifted to southerly due to the surface high 
propagating eastward over the last day. This has brought dewpoint
temperatures back into the mid 50s and a gradual increase into the
60s is expected over the weekend prior to another frontal passage. 
This could allow for some patchy fog in lower lying areas and some
shallow diurnal cu during the daytime, but with deep mid-level 
dry air prevailing and warmer 700mb temperatures, rain chances 
will be near zero through Sunday. As such, little adjustments were
required to the short term forecast period and leans fairly close
to NBM deterministic guidance throughout. TJS

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Thursday night)
Issued at 209 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Monday appears to be the warmest day of the forecast period, but
not by much as high temperatures peak in the low to mid 80s and
morning lows in the upper 50s to low 60s. As the shortwave ridging
begins to amplify and propagate eastward downstream of a digging
trough late in the weekend and into Monday, mid-upper level winds
will begin to pivot from northwesterly to southwesterly. This will
signal a change to our weather pattern as a frontal boundary 
approaches the area on Tuesday.

Latest forecast guidance has trended a touch faster with the
frontal boundary arriving to the area with favorable forcing for 
ascent (diffluent flow and bulk shear of 40-50kt), sufficient 
instability (400-700 j/kg), and low-level moisture (PWAT >1.5") 
capable of more widespread rain chances on Tuesday and into 
Wednesday as the front passes. As a result PoPs have increased
since yesterday to 40-50% on Tuesday especially over the western
CWA. The origin of the environment during this period is 
characterized by a cutoff low that gets absorbed by the broader 
longwave trough over the southwest CONUS in combination with 
residual moisture from Tropical Storm Roslyn after it traverses 
Mexico from the Pacific this weekend. This shortwave trough is 
forecast to move eastward over Texas by Monday and begin to lift 
on Tuesday with the peak mid-level forcing currently forecast to 
move just north of our forecast area. While this dynamic system 
would be capable of producing heavier thunderstorm activity, 
significant severe weather appears less likely at this time.

Exact timing of the frontal boundary on Tuesday will be critical 
in whether the low 80s highs currently forecast verify with
confidence lowest in the northwest CWA and highest in the
southeast CWA. Even so, the airmass following this cold front is
not as cold as the one observed this past week and temperatures
are not expected to dip significantly. High temperatures through
the latter half of the weekend are expected to be in the mid to high
70s with low temperatures in the 50s. Morning low temperatures on
Thursday were nudged down toward the 50th percentile NBM in 
anticipation of lows efficiently cooling with less mixing, clear 
skies, and drier air. Main uncertainty with this decision was how 
low dewpoints would get post-front with guidance ranging from mid 
40s to low 50s. Otherwise, NBM guidance took priority in the
longer range with a slight chance of precipitation indicated
toward the end of the week. TJS

Mostly VFR conditions through the cycle. MCB may see some reduced
VIS early Saturday morning with some patchy fog around the site,
however, this should dissipate quickly around or after sunrise.
Otherwise, winds will become light and variable overnight tonight
before picking up to 10-15kt range by Saturday afternoon.

Winds are beginning to transition back from offshore to onshore as 
surface ridge that was draped along the northern Gulf Coast slides 
east. It looks to stay in that position in reference to the local 
coastal waters this weekend through early next week. The next 
potential frontal passage likely not until early/middle of next 
week. The strength of the frontal boundary is still uncertain, but 
at the least would likely have exercise caution conditions for 12-24 
hours.
