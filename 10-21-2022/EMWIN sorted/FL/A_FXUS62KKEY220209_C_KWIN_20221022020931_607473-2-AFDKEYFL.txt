GOES-16 nighttime microphysics reveals scattered showers across 
the southeastern coast of Florida and in portions of the Hawk
Channel and Straits of Florida. The shower activity results from 
a surface trough just east of Florida. The action has waned over
the past several hours. The weakening of the showers results from 
an unfavorable environment due to dry continental air mass and an
inversion at 833 MB. The adverse conditions will yield (0%) rain 
chances throughout the island chain over the next 48 hours. Late 
tonight, expect clear to partly cloudy skies in the Keys, with 
northerly winds ranging from 5 to 10 knots. Overnight temperatures
in the Keys will run from the upper 60s to low 70s.

Moderate northerly breezes will prevail over the coastal waters

.AVIATION...
(00Z TAFS)
Issued at 907 PM EDT Fri Oct 21 2022

VFR conditions will prevail through tonight at EYW and MTH. A thin 
layer of stratocumulus clouds will persist into tomorrow, with cloud 
bases mainly between 030-045. Both terminals are expected to remain 
dry through the TAF period. Surface winds will be mainly northerly 
at 9 to 13 knots, with gusts of 16 to 20 knots, which could cause 
issues with crosswinds.
