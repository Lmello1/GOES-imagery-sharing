Synopsis for the the SW N Atlantic including the Bahamas

.SYNOPSIS...A surface trough extends from 31N71W across the NW 
Bahamas to the N coast of Cuba along 80W. A stationary front
from SW of Bermuda through central Cuba will dissipate this

allow for northeast winds over the waters north of the Bahamas 
to strengthen to fresh to strong speeds Sat through Sun before 
diminishing.
