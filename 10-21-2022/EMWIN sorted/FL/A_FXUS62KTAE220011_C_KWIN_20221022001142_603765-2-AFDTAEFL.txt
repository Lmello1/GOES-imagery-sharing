.UPDATE...
Issued at 810 PM EDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Forecast is on track, no changes have been made.

&&

.NEAR TERM...
(Through Saturday)
Issued at 355 PM EDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Generally benign weather is expected through the next day or so with 
surface high pressure over the Southeast and mid-level ridging 
settling in overhead. A slow warming and moistening trend will 
continue with high temperatures climbing into the mid to upper 70s 
on Saturday. Lows are forecast in the upper 30s to mid 40s tonight, 
warming into the mid 40s to low 50s Saturday night.

&&

.SHORT TERM...
(Saturday night through Sunday night)
Issued at 355 PM EDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Ridging throughout the short term will allow fair weather to 
prevail; light winds, mostly clear skies and dry conditions. 
Overnight lows are expected to be in the upper 40s to low 50s, with 
daytime highs in the upper 70s to low 80s.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Monday through Thursday)
Issued at 355 PM EDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Throughout the long term, the inverted trough off the southeast 
coast will eventually dissipate into the large scale flow; that is 
it'll merge into the ridge. Before doing do, it will allow moisture 
to advect northward along the coast, then this moisture wraps around 
and heads southward towards our region. This will allow our dew 
points to increase into the upper 50s and low 60s Monday afternoon 
into Tuesday. 

An approaching trough will cut through the Central Plains before 
heading NE towards the Great Lake region. Given the aforementioned 
ridge over the region, as the trough makes its approach winds will 
shift to being southerly allowing moisture to be advected across the 
region from the Gulf. With this trough lifting out towards the NE, 
far to our north, most of the dynamics associated with it won't be 
available to provide large scale forcing for ascent. However, we do 
have some lower end PoPs for Wednesday, with a peak of up to 25% 
Wednesday afternoon. This could be attributed to moist air, a 
fairly weak LLJ around 20-30 kts, with some weak instability, 
around 500-1000 J/kg CAPE. When combined with good ole diurnal-
based instability the chances for some showers and maybe a 
thunderstorm or two are present, although they are low. 

Otherwise expect daytime highs generally in the low to mid 80s with 
overnight lows in the upper 50s to low 60s.

.AVIATION...
(00Z TAFS)
Issued at 657 PM EDT Fri Oct 21 2022

VFR conditions are expected to continue through this TAF period.

.MARINE...
Issued at 355 PM EDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Favorable boating weather prevails the next few days with northeast 
winds 10 to 15 knots and seas around 2 feet through the weekend. By 
Monday, a slight uptick in easterly winds may induce cautionary 
conditions. Thereafter, winds shift out of the southeast, then 
southerly ahead of the next cold front by mid week.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 355 PM EDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Another very dry day is expected on Saturday with minimum RH 
dropping into the mid 20% range in the afternoon. A warming and 
moistening trend will help alleviate these very dry conditions 
Sunday into early next week. High pressure will keep transport winds 
fairly light, therefore generally good to fair dispersions are 
expected.
