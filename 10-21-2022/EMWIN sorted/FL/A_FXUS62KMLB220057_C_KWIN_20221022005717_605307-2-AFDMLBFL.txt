.UPDATE...
Issued at 835 PM EDT Fri Oct 21 2022

The earlier line of showers offshore stretching from southern
Martin County NE to the offshore Volusia County waters continues
to brush the far southern Martin Coast as of around 9pm. A few
lightning flashes and a strike or two have also been observed,
but are so far remaining offshore. Expect this activity to persist
through the overnight hours, with shower chances diminishing for
land areas late tonight through sunrise. Clouds will also decrease
into early morning, with most places seeing clear to mostly clear 
skies by daybreak.

North winds continuing overnight, becoming mainly around 5mph or
so for inland areas. However, coastal sites could see winds remain
around 10mph, with breezy conditions over the waters. Lows tonight
falling as low as the mid-50s across Lake and northern Volusia
Counties. Upper 50s to lower 60s elsewhere, with mid-60s possible
along the immediate Treasure Coast.

.DISCUSSION...

This Weekend (previous)...Compact mid level cut off low just 
offshore ECFL will pivot NE Sat, then turn north and open up into 
a trough as it reaches NC on Sun. This will carry a piece of the 
inverted surface trough northward with it, while leaving a piece 
behind just north of the Bahamas. This keeps the area in N to NNE 
flow on its backside this weekend, keeping the local area 
generally dry and comfortable. Blended guidance confines 
mentionable POPs to the Atlantic waters, however wouldn't be 
surprised to see a brief sprinkle or two reach the barrier 
islands, but this would be inconsequential even if occurs. Sat 
temps U70s-L80s/L60s with Sun about 2F warmer for both maxes and 
mins.

.MARINE...
Issued at 835 PM EDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Isolated to scattered showers will continue overnight tonight
across the Atlantic waters, occasionally drifting onshore along
the far southern Treasure Coast. A lightning storm or two cannot
be ruled out. Breezy northerly to north-northeasterly winds around
15kts persisting overnight, with up to 15-20kts offshore south of
the Cape and the nearshore Treasure Coast waters. This will
maintain the threat of seas up to 6ft in these areas, where small
craft should continue to exercise caution. Seas 3-5ft elsewhere.

.HYDROLOGY...
Issued at 835 PM EDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Flooding along the Middle Saint Johns River Basin continues as 
the river slowly recedes. Interests along the river are reminded 
that it will take several weeks for the river to return to its 
banks.

The St. Johns river at Astor is currently around 4.0 feet. 
Northerly winds are expected slow or halt the decline, keeping the
river at or near Major Flood Stage into the weekend.

Near Deland, the river will remain in Flood Stage at or above 4.0 
feet for the foreseeable future. The river is currently at 5.7 
feet, and is forecast to very slowly decline to 5.4 feet by the 
late weekend.

Near Sanford, the river will remain in Flood Stage at or above 5.5 
feet for the foreseeable future. The river is currently at 8.0 
feet, and is forecast to very slowly decline to 7.9 feet by the 
late weekend.

At Geneva above Lake Harney, the river will remain above the 10.0 
foot threshold for Major Flood Stage for the foreseeable future.
The river is at 10.7 feet and is forecast to very slowly decline 
to 10.6 feet by the late weekend.

Near Cocoa, the river remains just above Minor Flood Stage at 
16.1 feet. It is forecast to continue a slow decline, falling 
below Minor Flood Stage of 16.0 feet this weekend.
