.UPDATE...
Issued at 724 PM EDT Fri Oct 21 2022

It should be a generally quiet evening for South FL weatherwise. A
convergent line out over the Atlantic waters has been responsible
for persistent shower activity off the East Coast, and this 
activity could continue overnight. Temperatures tonight are
forecast drop to the upper 50s across interior SoFL, and low to 
mid 60s along the coasts.

.SHORT TERM...
(Rest of today through Saturday)

South Florida continues to sit under an area between surface high 
pressure centered over the Gulf, which extends north into the mid-
Atlantic, and an upper level trough that is positively-tilted and 
producing some showers with isolated thunderstorm chances over the 
Atlantic. With the tilt, the focus of any convection will continue 
to be around the east coast and the Atlantic even as it becomes 
neutral in the next 1-1.5 days. Plentiful dry air is present over 
land areas above 700-800mb, but there is enough low level moisture 
to spark a few low top showers and even a thunderstorm for the east 
coast metro areas due to the trough and any drifting convection from 
the Atlantic. Therefore, there is a limited lightning risk for the 
east coast today with PoPs in the chance category (~30-35%). A 
similar situation sets up for tomorrow, but with the trough shifting 
more over the water and high pressure ridging arriving behind it 
this weekend we should see very limited shower coverage. 

Winds will stay breezy mainly out of the NNW today and shift 
slightly more to the N/NNE on Saturday. The breeziest winds in the 
short term are expected for today with gusts up to 20-25mph possible 
which will limit high temperatures today mostly in the upper 70s. A 
few spots will approach 80 degrees. After today, we gradually begin 
to warm up starting Saturday as temperatures rise into the low to 
mid 80s.

&&

.LONG TERM...
(Saturday night through next Thursday)

Models begin the long term with a rather quiet synoptic scenario 
weather-wise, with a mid level low lingering just east of the 
eastern seaboard pulling most of the deeper moisture away from 
SoFlo. This will combine with sfc high pressure across the region to 
keep POPs in single digits through Monday morning. 

By Monday afternoon, an area of disturbed weather seems to develop 
near the Bahamas, but latest long range solutions push this feature 
also northward and basically into the same location of the previous 
mid level low. Thus, the pattern of keeping most of the deep 
moisture away from SoFlo continues through much of the long term. 
POPs in in general remain in the 5 to 15 percent through the end of 
next week, with maybe slightly better chances over the Atlantic 
marine zones. All in all, mainly enjoyable SoFlo weather conditions 
should prevail with persisting high pressure in place. 

Temperatures will experience a modest warming trend with afternoon 
highs back into the mid-upper 80s by mid week.

.AVIATION...
(00Z TAFS)
Issued at 724 PM EDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Generally VFR conditions should prevail the TAF period. Some VCSH
will persist for some of the East Coast terminals through the late
night hours, but impacts for TAF sites should be minimal. Winds 
from the NNW at 5-10 kts will gradually veer from the NNE tomorrow
afternoon. 

&&

.MARINE...

SCEC conditions over the Atlantic continue today under gusty N/NNW 
winds. Gusts are expected to be in the 20-30kt range today before 
becoming less breezy over the weekend and into next week. These 
gusty N/NNW winds will keep seas elevated at 4-6ft before slowly 
decreasing over the weekend and next week. There will be a risk for 
scattered rain showers today with possible a few containing heavier 
rain. Drier conditions and less breezy conditions begin setting up 
after today.

&&

.BEACHES...

The risk for rip currents will become elevated this weekend for the 
Palm beaches and Miami beaches into next week as swell increases 
from low pressure over the Atlantic that moved through Florida prior 
to that. In addition, winds will become more northeasterly by Monday 
and stay mainly out of the north this weekend. Palm Beach county 
will have the highest risk with the highest swell, but the Miami 
beaches are expected to have a moderate risk by Monday.
