Synopsis for Altamaha Sound GA to Flagler Beach FL out to 60 nm-
825 PM EDT Fri Oct 21 2022

.SYNOPSIS...

The region will be between a high pressure ridge to the north northwest,
and an surface trough just east of area waters through tonight. 
This high pressure ridge will move a little further to the west 
Saturday into Sunday, as the core of the trough moves just east 
of waters. Enhanced winds and seas are forecast due to the gradient
between the high and this trough. There is a potential that this 
trough could develop a low center in it, which would further elevate
conditions. The trough to the east is expected to weaken early 
next week as the ridge to the west lifts more to the north. A cold
front is expected to move east southeast across the area around 
the middle of next week.
