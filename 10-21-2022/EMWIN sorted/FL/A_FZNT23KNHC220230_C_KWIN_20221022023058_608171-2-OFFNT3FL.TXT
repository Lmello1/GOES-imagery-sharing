Synopsis for the SW N Atlantic including the Bahamas
1030 PM EDT Fri Oct 21 2022

.SYNOPSIS...A surface trough extends from 31N71W across the NW 
Bahamas to the N coast of Cuba along 80W. A stationary front from
SW of Bermuda through central Cuba will dissipate this weekend.
The surface trough will lift N through the weekend, with low 
pressure expected to develop near 29N76W Sat afternoon then move N
of the area by Sun afternoon. The pressure gradient between the 
low and high pressure over the southeastern U.S. will allow for 
northeast winds over the waters north of the Bahamas to strengthen
to fresh to strong speeds Sat through Sun before diminishing.
