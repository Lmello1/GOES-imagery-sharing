For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:

Central Subtropical Atlantic:
A small, non-tropical area of low pressure located about 1300 miles 
east of Bermuda is producing limited shower activity. Although the 
environmental conditions are forecast to be only marginally 
conducive for development during the next few days, the low could 
still acquire some subtropical or tropical characteristics by early 
next week while it moves westward to west-northwestward at 20 to 25 
mph across the subtropical Atlantic. By the middle of next week, 
further development appears unlikely as the system is forecast to 
move over cooler waters and encounter stronger upper-level winds. 
Additional information on this system, including gale warnings, can 
be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather 
Service.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.
