.UPDATE...
Issued at 817 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

A few high clouds are roaming around Middle TN at update time,
but this won't have an effect on anything tonight. Temperatures
will continue to drop off, but end up being much warmer than we've
seen over the last several nights thanks to a southwesterly flow
that developed over the last 24 hours. This increase in
temperatures will be the story through the weekend as we still
don't have any rain in the forecast until Tuesday. Upper 70s
tomorrow and even some low 80s on Sunday. A great weekend on tap.

.SHORT TERM...
(This afternoon through Saturday Night)
Issued at 132 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

A warm, southwesterly flow has developed over Middle Tennessee now
that the surface ridge has shifted to our east. As a result,
temperatures have warmed considerably, and dew points have also
increased even though we remain dry and mostly sunny. Tonight
won't be nearly as chilly as the past several nights when many
locations dropped to freezing or below. (It will be quite some 
time before we experience freezing temperatures again.) Tomorrow 
we'll remain sunny and even warmer than today.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through next Friday)
Issued at 132 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

A persistent southwesterly flow will bring increasingly warmer air
with higher dew points into the area Sunday and Monday, and with
the upper ridge passing to our east Sunday or Sunday night, this
will pave the way for the next active weather system early next
week. Expect showers to begin developing on Tuesday as a strong 
low pressure system & upper low race out of the Ark-La-Tex region 
and across Middle Tennessee. Normally, such a deep, progressive 
system would be a significant weather-producer, but with so little
available moisture, QPF's with this system range from trace 
amounts along the Cumberland Plateau to almost one-half inch along
the Tennessee River. Rain chances will linger on Tuesday night 
and possibly into Wednesday as the surface and upper low pass very
close by to the north. Afterwards, temperatures will cool by only 
a few degrees as the cold advection behind this active weather 
system is rather anemic due to the close proximity of the low. The
next chance of showers could come as early as next Friday or 
Friday night.

.AVIATION...
(00Z TAFS)
Issued at 557 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Southerly/southwesterly surface winds can be expected going
forward. An upper ridge axis is now in place over the mid state.
The axis will shift east on Saturday with a more uniform southerly
flow to follow. Scattered cu will be possible by the afternoon, 
as dewpoints climb and convective temps trend downward.
