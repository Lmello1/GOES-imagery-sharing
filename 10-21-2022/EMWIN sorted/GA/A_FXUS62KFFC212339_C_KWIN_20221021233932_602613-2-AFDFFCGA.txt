.SHORT TERM...
(This afternoon through Saturday)
Issued at 243 PM EDT Fri Oct 21 2022

High pressure over the area will continue to dominate the weather 
pattern and keep things dry through the weekend. Temperatures have 
rebounded and only expecting lows tonight to dip down into the Upper 
30s and 40s. The surface ridge axis moves over the Appalachians Sat 
which put North and Central GA in warmer easterly flow. Hi temps 
Saturday will get up into the 70s with lows Sunday morning only 
getting down into the mid to upper 40s.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday morning through next Thursday)
Issued at 243 PM EDT Fri Oct 21 2022

As the long term forecast begins on Sunday morning, a closed off 
upper low over the western Atlantic will be moving northward towards 
the NC/VA coast, with zonal upper level flow briefly setting up over 
Georgia before ridging develops once again during the early part of 
the work week as a longwave trough over the western CONUS begins to 
dig into the Great Plains region. A gradual warming trend will be 
ongoing during the early parts of the forecast period, with high 
temperatures in the mid 70s on Sunday afternoon increasing into the 
upper 70s and low 80s (about 4-8 degrees above climatological 
normals) by Tuesday afternoon. Dewpoints will be on a steady upward 
trend during this time as well, especially so by Tuesday afternoon 
as the ridge axis clears the forecast area to the east, 
southwesterly flow sets up aloft, and dewpoints climb into the upper 
50s. In the absence of any forcing mechanisms, precipitation is not 
expected from Sunday through Tuesday.

Uncertainty still exists with respect to the timing evolution of the 
aforementioned trough as it moves through the central CONUS and 
approaches the Southeast by mid-week. Mid-range guidance is becoming 
more consistent on the developing an associated surface low near the 
Ozark region by Tuesday afternoon, with a cold front extending 
southward into the Mississippi River Valley area. However, run-to-
run inconsistency remains in the strength, track, and speed of this 
low pressure system once it develops. For example, the latest ECMWF 
solution indicates a weaker system moving quickly into the Midwest 
by Wednesday morning, while the latest GFS indicates a stronger, 
occluded low taking a more southerly track at a significantly slower 
speed. In the former case, precipitation ahead of the cold front 
would arrive as early as Tuesday night, while in the latter case, 
the main window of precipitation would be during the afternoon and 
evening hours on Wednesday. At this time, the front is anticipated 
to be weakening as it moves towards the forecast area. With weak 
forcing and little to no instability. As a result, the main mode of 
precip is expected to be scattered showers, with rainfall totals of 
less than 1/4" across north and central Georgia.
