...AVIATION UPDATE...

Key Messages:

1. A Red Flag Warning will end at 7 PM for areas northwest of a line 
from Galena Missouri to Lake of the Ozarks. 

2. Near-record warmth continues through Sunday. 

3. Gusty south winds likely this weekend, with gusts over 40 mph 
possible each afternoon.

4. Heavy rainfall possible Monday-Tuesday.

.SHORT TERM...(This evening through Saturday)
Issued at 228 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Red Flag conditions continue northwest of a line from Galena 
Missouri to Lake of the Ozarks this afternoon. Observations from 
Laclede and Camden Counties show relative humidity below 20 percent.
Although winds have remained at or slightly below Red Flag 
criteria, warm temperatures and very dry grasses and soils
combined with low RH will keep the enhanced fire threat over the
area for the next several hours.

Temperatures have climbed into the upper 70s to lower 80s this
afternoon, which is within a few degrees of record highs for most
locations. More details are included in the climate section
below. 

Dewpoint temperatures will increase overnight and Saturday as 
southerly winds ahead of a developing storm system over the Plains
pull moisture northward from the Gulf of Mexico. The increasing 
moisture will help decrease fire danger for Saturday and Sunday, 
but gusty south winds and warm temperatures will enhance fire 
potential. Thus, limited to elevated fire potential will continue 
through the weekend. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday Night through Friday)
Issued at 228 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

The main focus for next week will be precipitation chances 
on Monday and Tuesday. Models trends continue to show increasing
precipitation chances and accumulation from early Monday through 
late Tuesday as the developing storm system to our west taps into 
tropical moisture from TS Roslyn. While the better surface 
convergence occurs with the cold front passage on Monday 
afternoon/evening, the eastward progress of the front will 
decrease as the upper trough deepens and leads to pressure falls 
over the Red River Valley. This will prolong our precipitation 
chances and likely lead to several inches of rain in some 
locations. 

With very dry soils over the region we think flooding will be 
isolated at best. Also, even though vertical wind shear will be 
strong over the region, instability looks pretty limited over the 
region, so severe potential is expected to remain low. 

Rain is expected to end Tuesday evening as the upper low
shifts east into the Ohio Valley. High pressure will build 
southward from Canada and bring a return to cooler temperatures. 
Another storm system may impact the region on Friday and into next
weekend.

afternoon through the weekend. We may also see overnight lows 
approaching warm minimum temperature records.
