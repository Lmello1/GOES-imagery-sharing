This Hazardous Weather Outlook is for portions of the Missouri
Ozarks and extreme southeast Kansas.

Weather hazards expected...

 Elevated fire weather risk.

DISCUSSION...

Elevated fire danger will continue through the evening across much
of the area. Dry fuels in response to the ongoing drought will

Gusty southerly winds are expected this weekend. Winds could gust
as high as 40 mph on Saturday and 45 mph on Sunday. The highest 
gusts will be across far western Missouri and southeast Kansas, 
creating elevated fire weather conditions with the potential for
rapid spread of wildfires. 

Showers and thunderstorms with locally heavy rainfall will be 
possible from early Monday through Tuesday evening, with some
locations potentially receiving several inches of rainfall during
this time.
