Fire Weather Planning Forecast FOR S Cntrl and Sern Colorado
National Weather Service Pueblo Co
717 PM MDT Fri Oct 21 2022

...A Red Flag Warning is in effect for the I-25 Corridor and 
the southeast Plains from 11 AM to 7 PM Saturday...

...A Fire Weather Watch is in effect for portions of the 
southeast Plains from late Sunday morning through Sunday evening...

.Discussion...

Increasing west to southwest flow aloft will bring increasing 
fire danger to the region through the weekend, with windy to 
very windy conditions expected later Saturday and Sunday across
the entire district, as a strong weather system moves across 
the Rockies. This system will also bring the first significant 
snowfall to the higher terrain of the Continental Divide Saturday
night and Sunday, with more scattered rain and snow showers over 
and near the rest of the higher terrain. This passing weather system 
will bring in cooler temperatures and possible showers to all of 
the district on Monday, with below seasonal temperatures expected to 
continue through the middle of next week.  

Smoke dispersions on Saturday afternoon and again on Sunday will be 
very good or better across much of the district.
