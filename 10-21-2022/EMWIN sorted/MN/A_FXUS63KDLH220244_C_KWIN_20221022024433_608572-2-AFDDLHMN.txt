.DISCUSSION...(This evening through Thursday)
Issued at 329 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Summary: Heating up with dry weather followed by storms 
Sunday/Monday then getting cooler and drier for the remainder of 
the forecast.

A warm front will lift north overnight and may bring a little 
rain to the northern tier of the forecast area. The pressure 
gradient will tighten Saturday and Sunday as an area of low 
pressure deepens and slowly moves northeastward advecting a lot of
warm air northward. This is leading to anonymously large 
deviations from climatological norms with much of the Northland in
the Shift of Tails spectrum (Top 10%) of the Euro climatic 
normals for the last 20 years for this time period. This may give 
us a shot at breaking some record temperatures (especially warm 
lows). Also, with this warmth, there will be a threat for 
thunderstorms as a low pressure feeds off of this baroclinicity. 
There will be plenty of shear present, but the low level thermal 
profiles have a persistent warm nose (cap) that is reluctant to 
break. So far, the SPC has a marginal risk on Day 3 just to our 
southern border – presumably because that cap will limit the 
convective potential in our neck of the woods. Model agreement is 
quite good with this system – mainly being forced by an upper 
level long wave with strong dynamics. The system looks a little 
more positively tilted compared to a few days ago, bust still 
robust nonetheless. A dry slot will be in contention in our 
general vicinity thus the QPF is fairly low with such a abnormally
warm system with PWATs in the 1.5” vicinity. It should be tough 
to “realize” those with that cap in place. 

The rest of the forecast looks fairly quiet with nothing 
significant to mention except that temperatures will return to 
near normal.

NOTE: Saturday will be fairly breezy and dry and with the fresh,
dry leaves scattered everywhere, the fire danger may be higher
than normal given the meteorological conditions.

.AVIATION...(For the 00Z TAFS through 00Z Saturday evening)
Issued at 632 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

VFR conditions prevail as broken high clouds setup at all
terminals in the next few hours. Showers are expected to pass
through the far northern Borderlands starting around 04z Sat and 
push eastward by late tonight so the VCSH has been placed at INL 
for these conditions. Very light westerly winds overnight back to 
southerly by early Saturday and then to southeasterly into 
Saturday. Afternoon gusts to 15-18 kts are most likely at BRD and 
HYR Saturday afternoon.

.MARINE...
Issued at 932 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Southerly winds tonight shift easterly by Saturday morning and
then increase into the afternoon. Gusts to around 20 kts along the
North Shore by mid-Saturday afternoon and building wave heights
could eventually require small craft advisories into tomorrow 
evening for those nearshore waters. Wind gusts decrease Saturday 
overnight as winds veer southerly ahead of a large area of low 
pressure approaching the Upper Midwest. These elevated southerly 
winds should linger through late Monday at the earliest. The warm 
nature of this flow pattern is expected to limit the deepest vertical
mixing down to the surface, but there may however, be some of the
stronger gusts that could still warrant another period of small 
craft advisories. This system will also have a thunderstorm 
lightning threat Sunday into Monday as a 984 mb low crosses north 
through central Minnesota.
