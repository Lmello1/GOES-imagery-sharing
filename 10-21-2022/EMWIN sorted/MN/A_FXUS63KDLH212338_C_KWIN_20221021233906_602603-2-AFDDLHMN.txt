.DISCUSSION...(This evening through Thursday)
Issued at 329 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Summary: Heating up with dry weather followed by storms 
Sunday/Monday then getting cooler and drier for the remainder of 
the forecast.

A warm front will lift north overnight and may bring a little 
rain to the northern tier of the forecast area. The pressure 
gradient will tighten Saturday and Sunday as an area of low 
pressure deepens and slowly moves northeastward advecting a lot of
warm air northward. This is leading to anonymously large 
deviations from climatological norms with much of the Northland in
the Shift of Tails spectrum (Top 10%) of the Euro climatic 
normals for the last 20 years for this time period. This may give 
us a shot at breaking some record temperatures (especially warm 
lows). Also, with this warmth, there will be a threat for 
thunderstorms as a low pressure feeds off of this baroclinicity. 
There will be plenty of shear present, but the low level thermal 
profiles have a persistent warm nose (cap) that is reluctant to 
break. So far, the SPC has a marginal risk on Day 3 just to our 
southern border – presumably because that cap will limit the 
convective potential in our neck of the woods. Model agreement is 
quite good with this system – mainly being forced by an upper 
level long wave with strong dynamics. The system looks a little 
more positively tilted compared to a few days ago, bust still 
robust nonetheless. A dry slot will be in contention in our 
general vicinity thus the QPF is fairly low with such a abnormally
warm system with PWATs in the 1.5” vicinity. It should be tough 
to “realize” those with that cap in place. 

The rest of the forecast looks fairly quiet with nothing 
significant to mention except that temperatures will return to 
near normal.

NOTE: Saturday will be fairly breezy and dry and with the fresh,
dry leaves scattered everywhere, the fire danger may be higher
than normal given the meteorological conditions.

.AVIATION...(For the 00Z TAFS through 00Z Saturday evening)
Issued at 632 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

VFR conditions prevail as broken high clouds setup at all
terminals in the next few hours. Showers are expected to pass
through the far northern Borderlands starting around 04z Sat and 
push eastward by late tonight so the VCSH has been placed at INL 
for these conditions. Very light westerly winds overnight back to 
southerly by early Saturday and then to southeasterly into 
Saturday. Afternoon gusts to 15-18 kts are most likely at BRD and 
HYR Saturday afternoon.

.MARINE...
Issued at 329 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

A large area of low pressure will approach bringing strengthening
southerly winds beginning Saturday and lingering through late 
Monday at the earliest. These winds are going to be fairly warm, 
thus should not mix down to the surface very efficiently. They may
however, be strong enough to warrant some small craft advisories.
This system will also have a thunderstorm lightning threat Sunday
into Monday as a 984 mb low crosses north through central 
Minnesota.
