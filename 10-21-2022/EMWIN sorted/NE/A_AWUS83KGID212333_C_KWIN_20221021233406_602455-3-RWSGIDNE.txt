Weather Summary for Portions of the Central Plains
National Weather Service Hastings NE
633 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

A nice start to the weekend is expected across the local area with 
light southerly winds and unseasonably warm temperatures in store 
for the local area. The combination of these warm temperatures with 
a dry air mass will make for near critical fire weather conditions 
across parts of the local area by afternoon...but thanks to the 
steady but lighter southerly winds...critical fire weather 
conditions should be averted Saturday afternoon. For 
Sunday...another unseasonably warm afternoon combined with very 
windy conditions ahead of an approaching cold front...will make for 
more critical fire weather concerns. In addition to the fire weather 
concerns...wind gusts to 50 mph will result in areas of blowing dust 
across the local area...which could result in both hazy skies and 
temporarily reduced visibilities. As the front crosses the local 
area Sunday evening...there will also be a slight chance for 
thunderstorms...although most areas will likely remain dry. Behind 
this cold front...much more seasonable temperatures and mainly dry 
conditions will be in store for the local area through the end of 
next week.
