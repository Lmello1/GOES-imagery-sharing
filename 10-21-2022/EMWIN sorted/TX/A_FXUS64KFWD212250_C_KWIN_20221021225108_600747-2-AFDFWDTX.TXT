.SHORT TERM... /NEW/
Update:
Today ended up being a bit warmer than expected compliments of
increasing low level warm air advection, plenty of sun and some
adiabatic warming. Highs were generally in the upper 80s and lower
90s (about 10 to 15 degrees above normal). Strong level warm air
advection will continue tonight and Saturday with very warm and
breezy weather expected. Therefore, the fire threat will remain
elevated on Saturday, but increasing low level moisture will 
lessen the threat slightly. 

No significant changes are needed to the forecast at this time.

Previous Discussion:
/Through Saturday/

Mostly sunny, wind, and very warm is the main theme for the early
weekend period. The lowest humidity values throughout the period 
is expected to reside across the western third or so of forecast. 
Combined with dry antecedent grasses and small fuels, elevated
grass fire conditions will continue across the western counties. 
Low-amplitude ridging aloft will gradually evolve into southwest 
flow with the approach of our system early next week (to be 
discussed more in detail below). This will create a stable and 
warm layer aloft that's enhanced from low static stability 
occurring off the the mountain ranges of West Texas and the Sierra
Madre of Northeast Mexico. This will keep the area rain-free,
though elevated moisture from TS Roslyn in the Eastern Pacific 
gets tapped into with increasing high clouds later on Saturday. 
Low level moisture and early morning stratus should develop across
those areas primarily east of I-35/35E, thanks to a strong and 
veered flow above the surface at 925mb.

Highs will range from the mid 80s East Texas to the Lower 90s 
across the higher terrain along and west of the Highway 281 
corridor each afternoon. Gusty south winds 15-20 mph may bring a 
little relief, but it will likely feel more like a warm blow 
dryer than any cooling effect. In addition, Saturday morning low 
temperatures won't be quite as cool and crisp as recent mornings
thanks to some stratus across the eastern zones and gusty south
winds across much of the area. Look for lows Saturday morning to
only fall into the 60s across much of the area.

.LONG TERM... /Issued 203 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022/
/Saturday Night Through Late Next Week/

Warm and breezy weather will continue the rest of the weekend;
however, winds should be due south on Sunday, which should keep
temperatures a few degrees lower than previous days, mainly 
across our western zones. Elsewhere, another day of temperatures 
in the mid to upper 80s can be expected. 

Relief will be on the horizon by the time we enter early next 
week, as our next rain-producing system arrives Monday morning as
an upper low digs into the Four Corners Region. Showers and 
thunderstorms should develop across West Texas early Monday and 
will move east through North and Central Texas throughout the day.
Moisture return ahead of the system will be rather impressive, 
resulting in a threat for locally heavy rain. However, despite an
abundance of shear, instability will be quite limited, ultimately
keeping the severe weather threat at a minimum. Nonetheless, 
we'll continue to monitor for any significant changes over the 
weekend as we get within range of high-res guidance. 

Rain chances will linger into Tuesday as a cold front eventually
sweeps through the area, though there's still some uncertainty in
the precise timing of the front. However, confidence continues to
increase that many folks should see a nice soaking of rain Monday
and/or Tuesday, with most locations picking up 1-2" over the
course of the event. Isolated higher amounts will certainly be 
possible but will largely depend on where the greatest rainfall 
coverage occurs - a detail still largely in question. Otherwise, 
precipitation will gradually end from west to east on Tuesday, 
with cooler air filtering into the region behind the departing 
system. 

Below-normal temperatures are expected on Tuesday, but will
gradually return to near-normal values in the 70s by Thursday. Our
next cold front may not be too far away, as guidance is hinting at
another cool down and additional chances for rain late next week.
Stay tuned!

.AVIATION... /NEW/
/00Z TAFS/

VFR at all TAF sites through tonight with a clear sky. Patchy 
stratus will likely develop across South Texas and possibly the 
Hill Country overnight as low level moisture surges northward,
compliments of a 40+ knot southwesterly low level jet. Low 
ceilings typically have a tough time making it into North Texas on
the first night of return flow, but Waco could see some very 
brief MVFR ceilings around sunrise Saturday.

A south wind will continue in the 10 to 15 knot range through
Saturday morning. The gusts we have been seeing this afternoon 
will likely drop off after sunset but will return and increase 
later this evening/overnight as some higher momentum air 
associated with the LLJ filters through the decoupled boundary 
layer. Sustained wind speeds and gusts will increase from late 
morning through the afternoon with a tight surface pressure 
gradient in place. Wind speeds will range from 14 to 20 knots 
with some gusts near 30 knots.
