.SHORT TERM...
(This afternoon through Saturday night)
Issued at 211 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Temperatures today will continue warming up with highs mostly in the 
80s. Surface winds will be breezy out of mainly the southwest to 
west this afternoon across West Texas and Southeast New Mexico. Low 
temperatures tonight will mostly be in the 50s and 60s. An upper 
trough will begin digging southward over the western part of the 
country on Saturday. Surface winds will again become gusty out of 
mainly the southwest on Saturday afternoon with westerly upper level 
winds. This will lead to temperatures continuing to warm up on 
Saturday. Highs on Saturday may reach the lower 90s across parts of 
the Permian Basin, along and near the Pecos River, and along the Rio 
Grande. In fact, the high temperature at Midland may be near the 
record high of 91 for Saturday. Temperatures Saturday night/Sunday 
morning will continue to warm with lows in the 50s and 60s. No 
precipitation is expected in the short term.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through Thursday)
Issued at 211 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Sunday will be our warmest day of the extended with temperatures 
reaching into the mid 80s for many. An upper low will move towards 
the area Sunday evening and into Monday morning. Rain chances will 
increase from west to east over the course of Monday with best 
chances for rain remaining in the northern half of the forecast 
area. Showers will be scattered in nature with accumulations nearing 
a quarter inch in some spots. A jet will round the bottom of this 
system with the core looking to sit west to east near or across the 
Guadalupe Mountains before pushing eastward. Wind directions will
be westerly to southwesterly across GDP and lead to some strong 
sustained winds or gusts. For now, will hold off on issuing high 
wind products as these stronger winds may trend downward or be 
short in duration on Monday afternoon. 

A developing surface low will move across the area during the day on 
Monday with an associated cold front moving through during the late 
afternoon. The cooldown behind the front will not be immediate as 
the cooler, drier air will lag by several hours before moving in 
behind the exiting upper low. Morning lows will be in the 40s over 
the middle of the coming week. Highs will be near 70 with low 
relative humidities to keep conditions feeling fall-like.
