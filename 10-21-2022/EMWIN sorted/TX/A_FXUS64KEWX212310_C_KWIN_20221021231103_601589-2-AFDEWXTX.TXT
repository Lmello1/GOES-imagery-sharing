.SHORT TERM...
(Tonight through Saturday night)
Issued at 137 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Clear skies prevail across the region today as dry air remains in 
place. Temperatures this afternoon range from the upper 70s to lower 
80s and highs later today should top out in the 80s for most 
locations. The dry air and warm temperatures will lead to humidity 
values bottoming out near 25-30 percent later today. Winds are out 
of the south/southwest around 10 to 15 mph in places and will lead 
to elevated to near critical fire weather conditions when combined 
with the lower humidities. 

Dry weather will continue to prevail throughout the short-term 
period of the forecast. Lows tonight will be in the 50s to lower 
60s. Humidity will be on the increase tomorrow and will not have to 
be concerned with any fire growth potential. Highs will a bit warmer 
once again with some locations flirting with 90 degrees. Tomorrow 
night, with the increase in dewpoints, lows will be back into the 
lower to middle 60s with a slight increase in cloud cover as well.

(Sunday through Friday)

Daytime weather on Sunday should look a lot like that of Saturday
with morning cloudiness, humid and breezy conditions and some
sunshine breaking in for the afternoon. A few more high clouds will
roll in late Sunday as an unstable SW flow aloft develops in advance
of a potent upper storm system. 

The approaching storm system has been shown with improved confidence
to be on a fast track to begin impacting the foreast area as early 
as the predawn hours Monday morning. Tropical Storm Roslyn will have
surged NE into the Mexican coast by this time and is expected to 
strengthen into a Hurricane before doing so. The remnants will break
up quickly over the high terrain portions of Wrn Mexico, but
fragments of vorticity and mid and upper level moisture are expected
to destabilize the air over South Central TX to warrant some light 
early morning PoPs over western counties. By midday Monday, the PWAT
values combining Gulf moisture with Pacific moisture aloft will surge
into the 1.8 to 2.2 inch range across most of the forecast area.

What's left of the mid level dynamics from Roslyn is expected stream
NE across the area early in the day, but there remains a bit of
uncertainty if the moisture loading can get the PWat values into that
range as this first round of energy rolls across. With some pockets
of dry air still in place, there could be some elevated thunderstorm
characteristics with this first wave, which reminds this forecaster 
of the initial character of the heavy rain event scenario of around 
Oct 13/14 2021 when Pamela tracked roughly the same track over our 
area. It is a somewhat similar pattern, but in the case of Pamela's
impacts, the upper flow was in more of a longwave upper trough,
whereas the upper low opening up over TX Monday will be faster and
more capable of producing a few strong storms. Confidence is not
quite at a level to begin messaging severe concerns or even heavy
rain concerns. Should this pattern continue showing acceleration
trends, we could be shifting emphasis more in favor of severe weather
and less in the heavy rain. So with an assessment of equal threat
levels for this package a vague number to throw out for amounts given
what looks like a good WPC QPF, might be 1-3 inch, isolated 5 inch
type event.

With the accelerated timing, temps for Monday and Tuesday remain
suppressed off the NBM guidance, as abundant clouds are expected
Monday, and mixing of cool air to the surface behind the Pacific
front is expected Tuesday. Mild and dry air should finish out the 7
day forecast.

VFR conditions are expected through the forecast period. Some
morning clouds could develop around sunrise across the southern 
Edwards Plateau but dissipating a few hours later. Winds continue 
from the south around 5 to 10 knots this evening through Saturday 
morning. For the afternoon, wind speeds come up between 10 to 12 
knots with gusts up to 25 knots especially for KAUS.
