.SHORT TERM...
(Tonight through Saturday night)
Issued at 234 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

The 500mb trough digging over the east coast and Gulf of Mexico will 
tighten the pressure gradient over the coastal counties and Gulf 
Waters for the Short Term period. Southeasterly gusts are currently 
around 20 mph today, but could get up to 25 mph on Saturday. 
Otherwise, mid-level zonal flow dominates over Texas through the 
weekend bringing rain-free and mostly sunny conditions.

As for today and tomorrow's highs, upper 80s to lower 90s are 
forecast with mostly sunny skies. Had to go a couple degrees above 
NBM for the daytime highs today and tomorrow. For tonight's lows, 
went almost 5 degrees below the NBM based on last night's 
temperature observations. Have upper 50s across the CWA as opposed 
to what the NBM had which was lows in the mid 60s. Temperatures 
struggled to get out of the lower 50s last night and mostly clear 
skies are forecast again tonight. Tomorrow's lows are bit warmer as 
more clouds stick around overnight with lows in the mid 60s.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through next Friday)
Issued at 234 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

A 500 mb ridge over the region will continue to shift eastward into 
the Gulf of Mexico at the end of the weekend as a midlevel trough 
across the Great Basin swings into the Southwest. This trough will 
then pick up a Baja Low on Monday and continue eastward and dragging 
a cold front into the upper Great Lakes southwards through the 
middle Mississippi Valley into central Texas by Tuesday. Meanwhile, 
Tropical Storm Roslyn in the eastern Pacific will make landfall as a 
Hurricane in western Mexico Sunday morning. As the aforementioned 
trough swings into the Rockies and Plains, it will likely pick up at 
least some moisture from Roslyn. This excess moisture along with 
additional lift will help to increase chances of precipitation 
across Deep South Texas, ahead of the aforementioned front. 
Precipitation chances increase slightly on Monday, mainly in the 
form of streaming/seabreeze showers or an isolated thunderstorm, 
along the coast increasing in chances and expanding into the rest of 
the CWA into Tuesday with the approach of the cold front. As 
mentioned in the previous forecast discussion, models continue to 
come into better agreement with the timing of the frontal passage 
and precipitation chances with passage likely on Tuesday.

This cold front will be weaker and not as dramatic as the last cold 
front in terms of temperatures. Ahead of the front above normal 
temperatures will continue and only become slightly below normal by 
Tuesday and Wednesday before warming back by Friday as southerly 
flow returns.

The cold front will also bring increased winds, especially across 
coastal zones, into the Mid-Valley Sunday and Monday as the pressure 
gradient tightens ahead of the boundary. While Wind Advisory 
conditions are not anticipated at this time, it will be breezy.

At the end of the forecast period another midlevel disturbance/cold 
front will begin to approach the Southern Plains increasing chances 
for precipitation Thursday and Friday, again mainly across coastal 
areas. Watch for updates on this system in coming days.

Lastly, astronomical tides will increase late Tuesday through the 
remainder of the  week that could lead to minor coastal flooding 
near high tide cycles.

.AVIATION...
(00Z TAFS)
Issued at 625 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

VFR will prevail through the period with mostly clear skies and
light southeast winds after sunset. Southeast winds will become 
breezy again Saturday afternoon with gusts between 25-30 knots 
possible at all TAF sites.

.MARINE...
Issued at 234 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Tonight through Saturday Night: Pressure gradient tightens as a 
low over the Gulf of Mexico continues to strengthen through the 
weekend. Therefore, winds will become breezy and are expected to 
gust to around 30 mph by tomorrow afternoon. Small Craft Exercise 
Caution/Small Craft Advisories will be needed throughout the 
weekend.

Sunday through Thursday...Sunday and Monday southerly winds along 
the lower Texas cost will increase ahead of an approaching cold 
front. This will lead to hazardous marine conditions. Small Craft 
Advisories will be likely across all waters into Tuesday with 
conditions improving through the remainder of the period. Ahead of 
the aforementioned front, rain chances will increase Monday into 
Tuesday that could also create localized elevated winds and seas.
