.SHORT TERM...
(Tonight through Saturday night)
Issued at 239 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

The warm and dry weather will continue through the short term. South 
to southeasterly winds in the lower levels will draw in warm moist 
air, leading to warmer and more humid conditions Saturday. Skies 
will remain sunny to mostly sunny this afternoon through Saturday,
with clouds increasing to partly cloudy Saturday night. Highs for
Saturday will be in the 80s to near 90. Lows tonight will drop 
into the 60s. Saturday's lows will be warmer with temperatures in 
the mid 60s to low 70s.

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday through next Thursday)
Issued at 239 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Warm high temperatures and dry conditions will continue Sunday and 
Monday with moderate southeasterly winds. Moisture will rise above 
normal values ahead of a front expected to move across the area as 
the remnants of Tropical Cyclone Roslyn move over Texas. Model 
guidance has come to better agreement with the timing of the front 
expected to move across the area Monday night into Tuesday which 
will contribute to scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms, 
mainly over the Coastal Plains. The front will move offshore 
Tuesday, with showers and isolated thunderstorms lingering through 
Tuesday evening. Drier conditions will return Wednesday and should 
persist through the end of the week before the next cold front 
approaches the area.

Temperatures will be cooler on Tuesday, with highs struggling to 
reach the low 80s before onshore flow returns, gradually warming us 
up into the mid 80s by the end of the week.
