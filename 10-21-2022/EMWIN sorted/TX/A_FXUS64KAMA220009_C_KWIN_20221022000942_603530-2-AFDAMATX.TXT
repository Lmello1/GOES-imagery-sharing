.SHORT TERM ...
(This evening through Saturday night)
Issued at 251 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

A weak lee low developed across southeast Colorado this morning
and moved into the Oklahoma Panhandle with a surface trough
stretching along a line from Hooker to Guymon to Stratford to 
just north of Dalhart. A majority of the Panhandles has west 
southwest breezy winds expected today ahead of the surface trough 
with warm air advection giving way to highs into the 80s today. 
With zonal flow aloft for much of the central CONUS, moisture is 
lacking for the Southern Plains today.

Tomorrow, the flow aloft continues to be westerly as a new trough
digs into the Pacific Northwest as an upper closed low off the
coast of Baja Cali merges into the southern extent of the trough
axis. A 500mb jet axis develops of 50 to 60 knots will develop
through the day tomorrow over the forecast area. Another surface
low will develop ahead of the incoming trough axis across Wyoming
with 30 to 40 knot 850mb winds over the Panhandles. Southwest
surface winds with warm air advection will lead to temperatures
well into the 80s by tomorrow afternoon. Warm temperatures and dry
conditions will lead to mixing of these low level winds to the
surface with breezy southwest winds of 20 to 30 mph possible
tomorrow afternoon and gusts up to 35 to 40 mph.

.LONG TERM ...
(Sunday through next Thursday)
Issued at 251 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Sunday is still windy and the system is trending faster which will
limit precip and severely limit snow potential.

Sunday still looking for windy conditions and fire weather
concerns as a mid level closed low digs through into the Great
Basin region. Models show the low tracking east across the Rockies
and then splitting apart with some energy heading towards the
Dakotas and some energy still digging towards New Mexico. The
further south piece has some discrepancies between models. Model
trends are currently faster than previous runs and slightly
further south. The faster pace would make precip possibly come
through quicker, which shows in the NBM providing precip chances
Sunday evening again. With the quicker pace comes a change in snow
potential as well. The snow potential only is looking for when the
temps drop low enough, which would be Monday evening into Tuesday
morning. If the speed of the low does go faster as projected 
currently, the precip will be out of the north when temps drop, 
leaving no snow to be seen. There are a few GEFS members that 
still hold some snow chances in the northwest, so NBM does have a 
very low chance. If the trend holds though, would expect not to 
see snow happen. After the low passes east of the area, the
weather will become quiet until the next trough drops through the
western CONUS around Thursday which may provide another quick shot
of precip. Temps for the week should generally remain in the 60s
to low 70s.

(00Z TAFS)
Issued at 647 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

For the 00Z TAFS, southwest to west southwest winds will increase
on Saturday as the pressure gradient tightens in response to a
developing surface trof of low pressure across the eastern slopes
of the Rockies and adjacent high plains. Little to no cloud cover
is anticipated.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 251 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Elevated fire weather conditions are possible tomorrow across the
north and eastern Panhandles where minimum relative humidity
values dip into the lower to mid teens. Highest twenty foot winds
will mostly be across the southwest Panhandles where minimum
relative humidity values are between 20 to 25 percent. In the
areas where relative humidity drops into the teens, twenty foot
southwest winds will be around 15 to 25 mph.

Sunday still looking for elevated to critical fire weather
concerns. The winds are still on track to be 25 to 35 or 40 mph
with the highest speeds in the northwest from about Dalhart to
northwestern Beaver County. Gusts will top out in the northwest
around 50 mph and around 30 mph in the southeast TX Panhandle. RH
is still wiggling around from teens to 20s. Fuels will play a
large roll in fire starts as the driest grasses are in the
northeast with Beaver County being in the 90th percentile for
ERCs. The northwest where the highest wind speeds are is around
the 60th percentile. Right now, the northeast is being targeted
for critical fire weather with elevated for areas surrounding. A
cold front will start turning winds northerly on Monday morning.
Winds will generally be 15-20 mph. Precipitation may occur
starting Sunday evening in the southeast and spread across the
area.
