...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM CDT THIS EVENING...
...FIRE WEATHER WATCH IN EFFECT FROM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH
SUNDAY EVENING...

.DISCUSSION...
Issued at 354 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Saturday will feature another day of VERY HIGH grassland fire 
danger, due to breezy/gusty south winds, low humidity, and above 
normal temperatures. Thinking fire danger will be highest
generally 
along/southeast of the KS Turnpike where combination of stronger 
winds and low humidity will overlap. A few counties may reach red
flag criteria for a few hours, but decided against red flag
issuance 
at this time given questions with returning moisture and higher 
humidity creeping in during the afternoon.

Sunday will feature the greatest fire danger risk, given very 
strong/gusty south winds amidst continued above normal
temperatures. 
The greatest risk will be from central Kansas westward, where 
dewpoints/humidity will be less and winds a bit stronger, where a
fire weather watch as been issued. The main question further east
across eastern Kansas will be returning moisture, with dewpoints
in 
the 50s likely resulting in afternoon humidity values 40-45+ 
percent. This will likely eat into the fire danger some. Stay
tuned 
for possible fire weather headlines.
