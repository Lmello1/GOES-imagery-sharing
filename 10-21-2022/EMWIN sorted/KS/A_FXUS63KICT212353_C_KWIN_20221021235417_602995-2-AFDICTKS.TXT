.SHORT TERM...(This evening through Sunday night) 
Issued at 354 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

FORECAST HIGHLIGHTS THROUGH LATE NEXT WEEK:

* Very high to extreme grassfire danger through Sunday, with Sunday 
  having the greatest risk.

* Well above normal temperatures through Sunday.

* Decent chance for meaningful rainfall Monday-Tuesday, especially 
  southeast Kansas.

The main forecast concern through Sunday will be increasing grass 
fire danger (refer to FIRE WEATHER section below for details). Winds 
will be on the increase Saturday and especially Sunday, as low 
pressure deepens across the High Plains, in response to a deep upper 
low digging across the western CONUS. A tight pressure gradient and 
deep mixing amidst increasing deep atmospheric flow will support 
widespread 25-35 mph sustained winds, with gusts likely exceeding 45-
50 mph. Thinking gusts exceeding 55-60+ mph are possible across 
western portions of central KS, where moisture isn't as deep and 
associated mixing is deeper. For now, widespread high wind warning 
criteria appears unlikely, so will hold off on a high wind watch for 
now, although later shifts may need to consider western portions of 
central KS.

There is an outside chance for a stray thunderstorm or two Sunday 
evening west of the KS Turnpike, along a modestly sharpening and 
retreating dryline. Suspect marginal boundary layer moisture amidst 
poor dryline convergence and some capping issues will preclude storm 
development. However, if a storm can manage to get going, impressive 
vertical shear profiles would support an isolated severe threat. 
Stay tuned.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Friday) 
Issued at 354 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Models are beginning to converge on a common solution regarding 
widespread rain/storm chances Monday-Tuesday, as a deep upper trough 
ejecting onto Mid-America interacts with a strong frontal zone. 
Deterministic and ensemble consensus supports locations generally 
along and southeast of the KS Turnpike corridor to have the best 
chances, with less chances further northwest. While the threat for 
severe storms is low, above normal precipitable waters stemming from 
tropical remnants over the eastern Pacific may spell heavy rainfall 
amounts, with the potential for widespread 1-2+ inches. This would 
certainly help temper the exceptional drought currently gripping 
southeast Kansas. There still remains some uncertainty, so please 
stay tuned. 

Deterministic and ensemble consensus progress yet another deep storm 
system across Mid-America late next week, with another round of 
rainfall possible. There still remains quite a bit of uncertainty on 
exactly where this system will track though, along with the 
availability of deep moisture for potential heavy rainfall. Please 
stay tuned for later forecasts.

.AVIATION...(For the 00Z TAFS through 00Z Saturday evening)
Issued at 641 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

VFR conditions are expected for this TAF period. The only issue
will be some LLWS across the region during the night. This will
mainly affect the ICT and CNU terminals. The LLWS conditions will
abate a few hours after sunrise tomorrow.

.FIRE WEATHER...
Issued at 354 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022

Saturday will feature another day of VERY HIGH grassland fire 
danger, due to breezy/gusty south winds, low humidity, and above 
normal temperatures. Thinking fire danger will be highest generally 
along/southeast of the KS Turnpike where combination of stronger 
winds and low humidity will overlap. A few counties may reach red 
flag criteria for a few hours, but decided against red flag issuance 
at this time given questions with returning moisture and higher 
humidity creeping in during the afternoon.

Sunday will feature the greatest fire danger risk, given very 
strong/gusty south winds amidst continued above normal temperatures. 
The greatest risk will be from central Kansas westward, where 
dewpoints/humidity will be less and winds a bit stronger, where a 
fire weather watch as been issued. The main question further east 
across eastern Kansas will be returning moisture, with dewpoints in 
the 50s likely resulting in afternoon humidity values 40-45+ 
percent. This will likely eat into the fire danger some. Stay tuned 
for possible fire weather headlines.
