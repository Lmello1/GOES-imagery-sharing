RED FLAG...RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT FROM NOON TO 7 PM CDT

.DISCUSSION...
Warm and windy conditions will exist again Saturday, but for most
areas, afternoon humidites are expected to be higher than those
seen today. The higher humidities should limit the worst fire
weather conditions to Osage and Pawnee counties, although 
elevated fire spread conditions will exist for all areas.
