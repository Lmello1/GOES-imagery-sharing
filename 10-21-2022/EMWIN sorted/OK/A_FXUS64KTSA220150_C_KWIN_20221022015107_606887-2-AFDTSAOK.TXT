The main issue overnight will be an expected increase in wind
speeds early Saturday morning as the low level jet increases atop
eastern Oklahoma and northwest Arkansas. This increase could have
an impact on any ongoing fire fighting efforts, specifically the
one that remains highly visible on satellite in Osage County. 
While notable moisture return is expected tonight across much of 
the area, parts of northeast Oklahoma along and west of Highway 75
will be the last portions of the region to see the higher 
moisture. In addition, with the winds staying up overnight, 
temperatures will be slow to fall. This combination will lead to 
relative humidities remaining fairly low for nighttime hours, 
likely only approaching 50 percent or so in northwestern sections 
of the forecast area. Overall, the going forecast has all of this
handled well, with the only notable change being to incorporate
some of the short-term guidance dew point values reflecting
reduced values west of Highway 75. Updated products will be out
soon.

Hot, dry, and windy weather will continue Saturday, but the 
associated fire risk will become increasingly limited to the 
northwestern portion of the CWA (west of state route 75) as low 
level moisture increases. Model guidance is in decent agreement that 
the dry line will move just far enough east on Saturday afternoon to 
result in drying for Osage/Pawnee Counties where the fire risk will 
be highest. In addition to the dry air, upper level winds will 
continue to strengthen, which will result in gusty surface winds. A 
Red Flag Warning is in effect for noon to 7 pm Saturday for Osage
and Pawnee Counties. 

By Sunday we will see the warm sector overspread the entire forecast 
area with much deeper moisture advecting into the region. Upper 
level wind speeds will max out on Sunday with 925 mb winds of 
40-50 kts, but these may not be fully reflected at the surface due
to increased cloud cover. ECMWF EFI values for surface wind 
exceed 0.9, representing a fairly anomalous event. EPS/NAEFS 
climatology for 850 hPa winds also exceed the 97th percentile for 
this time of year. Overall, surface wind gusts of 35-40 mph 
(highest to the NW and hilly areas) are expected Saturday and 
Sunday afternoons. These values are close to wind advisory 
criteria, but for now we will hold off due to lingering 
uncertainties. 

Heading into Monday several factors will come together to set the 
stage for a potentially heavy precipitation event. A deep trough 
over the Great Basin will merge with a cut off low over the SW USA.
Meanwhile, the unusual southern latitude of this deep trough will
advect moisture from a decaying tropical system in the east 
Pacific. These factors will result in anomalous PWAT values of 
around 1.75" by Monday afternoon. At the same time, strong 
isentropic ascent in the backdrop of good upper level diffluence 
will allow precipitation to blossom over the area. Most model 
guidance is showing the potential for a widespread 1-3" storm
total across the CWA during this period. Instability does not 
look particularly robust, which will keep the severe threat near 
zero with only a 15-25% chance of thunderstorms.

By Tuesday this precipitation band will be pushing east. Model 
uncertainty increases considerably during the day Tuesday. A compact 
upper level PV anomaly will be swinging through the area at the time 
and may induce a new surface low with associated wrap around
precipitation over the area. However, model guidance can't agree 
on whether this feature will exist, let alone the precipitation 
placement. Regardless, conditions will dry out by Wednesday with 
several days of highs in the mid to upper 60s anticipated.

(00Z TAFS)
Issued at 621 PM CDT Fri Oct 21 2022
Scattered high clouds will continue across NE OK/NW AR overnight 
in association with passing upper wave. LLWS will develop this 
evening and continue through mid morning Saturday in association 
with 50kt low level jet. Lower clouds are expected to hang up in 
the higher terrain areas of southeast Oklahoma Saturday morning 
with VFR conditions expected through the day Saturday. Otherwise, 
strong and gusty south winds expected in most locations through 
the day in advance of next storm system.
